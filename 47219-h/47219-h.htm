<span class="small">PROFESSOR OF METEOROLOGY, UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> circumstance which renders the coming total eclipse of
the sun, on May 28, 1900, of special significance to thousands
of people who might otherwise entirely overlook the occasion is
the fact that the path of the moon’s shadow over the surface of
the earth, or the track of the eclipse, is in such a convenient locality&mdash;namely,
in our Southern States&mdash;as to render the places of
visibility easily accessible. Instead of being obliged to go to the
ends of the earth, at a heavy expenditure of time and money, all
the while running the risk of not seeing the eclipsed sun on account
of prevailing cloudiness, we are fortunate this time to have the
show at home in our own country. While many foreigners will
be induced to come to the United States to make observations, it
is certain that more people will be in a position to see this eclipse
with a minimum amount of trouble than has ever happened before
in the history of eclipses, at least since the telescope was invented
and careful records of the phenomenon preserved.</p>

<p>The track of May 28th enters the United States in southeastern
Louisiana; passes over New Orleans, La., centrally; over Mobile,
Ala., which is on its southern edge; over Montgomery, Ala., on
the northern edge; over Columbus, Ga.; south of Atlanta, Ga.,
which lies about twenty-five miles to the north of it; near Macon,
Milledgeville, and Augusta, Ga., Columbia, S.&nbsp;C., Charlotte, N.&nbsp;C.;
over Raleigh, N.&nbsp;C., which is ten miles north of the central line;
and over Norfolk, Va., fifteen miles north of the center. The track
is about fifty miles wide in all parts, and the duration of the eclipse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
varies from one minute and twelve seconds near New Orleans to
one minute and forty-four seconds near Norfolk, on the central line.
These durations diminish from the maximum at the middle of the
track to zero at the northern and southern limits of it, so that an observer
must be stationed as near the central line as possible in order
to see much of the eclipse. The population of several of the above-mentioned
cities is at present as follows: New Orleans, 242,000;
Mobile, 31,000; Montgomery, 22,000; Columbus, 20,000; Atlanta,
66,000; Raleigh, 13,000; and Norfolk, 35,000. It is evident that
with very little exertion more than 500,000 people can see this
eclipse. It is most fortunate that the track passes near so many
cities, because, with their facilities for the accommodation of visitors,
many will be induced to undertake excursions with the purpose
of taking in this rare sight, and a little enterprise on the part
of railroads and transportation companies might easily increase
the numbers. If people will go to a parade, yacht race, or an exposition,
and consider themselves paid for their expenses, then surely
they will find in this great spectacle of Nature not only an object
of wonder and beauty, but also one of peculiar instruction in many
important branches of science. All educators who can induce their
pupils to make such an expedition will implant a love of astronomy
in many impressionable minds which will become a source of pleasure
to them for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <span class="notbold">(By permission of the United States Weather Bureau.)</span></div></div>

<p>Out of about seventy eclipses of the sun which have occurred
somewhere in the world within the nineteenth century, there have
been only eight total eclipses of more or less duration visible on
the North American continent. The others happened in places
often remote from civilization, and sometimes in entirely inaccessible
localities, as over the ocean areas. The difficulty of transporting
heavy baggage to the remote parts of Asia, Africa, or
South America is such as to preclude all but a few scientists from
any effort to observe eclipses. The writer was much impressed
with the formidable nature of undertaking to establish eclipse stations
in places which are distant from centers of population by his
own experience on the West African Eclipse Expedition, sent out
by the United States Government, for the eclipse of December
22, 1889, to Cape Ledo, on the west coast of Angola, about seventy
miles south of St. Paul de Loanda. Nearly eight months were
consumed in the course of the preparations at home and in the
voyage out and back. The expedition, it should be said, however,
went to Cape Town, South Africa, and halted also at St. Helena,
Ascension Island, and Barbados for magnetic and gravity observations,
so that all this time should not be charged to the eclipse
proper. We sailed in the old frigate Pensacola, the companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to Farragut’s flagship, the Hartford, with Captain Yates. In earlier
days Admiral Dewey commanded this ship, and the expedition
was fitted out while he was in charge of the Bureau of Equipment
at Washington. The same fine courtesy that has become so well
known to his countrymen was at that time extended to all the
members of the expedition.</p>

<p>The cloudiness along the track of the eclipse in the Southern
States on the 28th of May, 1900, is evidently a matter of much importance
not only for all astronomers, but for non-professional
spectators. If it could be foretold, with the same precision as the
astronomical data give the time and the place of the occurrence
of the eclipse, that the day itself will be fair or cloudy, or that
certain portions of the track will be clear while others will be obscured,
it would be of great benefit. The cost of these scientific
expeditions is very great, since it is necessary to transport many
heavy and delicate pieces of apparatus into the field, including telescopes,
spectroscopes, polariscopes, and photographic cameras, and
set them up in exact position for the day of observation. The expedition
to Cape Ledo, West Africa, in 1889, carried out a large
amount of material, prepared it for work during the totality, and
then entirely lost the sun during the critical moments by a temporary
obscuring of the sky through local cloud formations. There
had been some clouds at the station during the forenoons for several
days preceding the eclipse, but the sky was usually clear and
very favorable during the middle of the afternoons. The totality
came on at three o’clock, and photographs of the sun were taken
at first contact about 1.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span>; clouds thickened, however, and
totality was entirely lost, while the sun came out again for the last
contact at 4.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> This was a very trying experience, and of
course could not have been avoided by any possible precautions.
Some astronomers have thought that the advance of the moon’s
shadow is accompanied by a fall in temperature, and that cloudiness
is more likely to be produced from this cause.</p>

<p>Soon after the West African eclipse Professor Todd, of Amherst
College, proposed that more systematic observations be made
for the probable state of the sky along eclipse tracks, with the
view of at least selecting stations having the most favorable local
conditions. The method was tried in Chili, April, 15, 1893, and
in Japan, August 8, 1896, with some success. Heretofore the
available meteorological records, which were originally taken for
other general purposes, had been consulted, and some idea formed
of the prevailing tendency to cloudy conditions. In accordance
with the improved method, the United States Weather Bureau has
been conducting special observations on the cloudiness occurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
from May 15th to June 15th in each of the three years 1897, 1898,
and 1899, for the morning hours of the eclipse&mdash;between 8 <span class="smcap smaller">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
and 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.&nbsp;M.</span> A tabular form was sent through the local offices to
such observers as were willing to act as volunteers in making these
records, and their reports have been studied to discover how the
cloudiness behaves along the eclipse track at that season of the
year. Each of the three years gives substantially the same conclusion&mdash;namely,
that there is a maximum of cloudiness near the
Atlantic coast in Virginia, extending back into North Carolina,
and also near the Gulf coast in Louisiana and in southern Mississippi,
while there is a minimum of cloudiness in eastern Alabama
and central Georgia. The following table will serve to make
this plain:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The significance of these figures is shown by transferring them
to a diagram, given on <a href="#ip_5">Chart II</a>, which indicates the average cloudiness
prevailing over the several States where they are crossed by
the track. The marked depression in the middle portions, especially
over Alabama and Georgia, indicates that the stations in
these districts make a much better showing than those nearer the
coast line. The reasons for this difference are probably many in
number, but the chief feature is that the interior of this region,
especially over the higher lands of the southern reaches of the
Appalachian Mountains, which are from six hundred to one thousand
feet above the sea level, is somewhat freer from the moisture
flowing inland from the ocean at that season of the year. The
table shows also two divisions, one for the “general sky,” wherein
the relative cloudiness was noted in every portion of the visible
sky, and for the “sky near the sun,” where the observation was
confined to the immediate vicinity of the sun. The two records
agree almost exactly, except that the sky near the sun averages a
little lower than the general sky. This indicates that although the
sun will be seen in the morning hour of May 28th, when it is only
from thirty to forty degrees above the horizon, yet this is not an
unfavorable circumstance. The low altitude, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
makes it easier for those at the instruments to enjoy a more comfortable
observing position than if it were nearer the zenith, where
one must look directly upward. Of course, a storm of some kind
may occur on that day to modify these general weather conditions
and upset all calculations. While the cloud observations suggest
that Georgia and Alabama have the best sites for the eclipse, it
must be remembered that the duration is about one minute and
twenty seconds in Alabama, and one minute and forty seconds in
North Carolina. As a gain of twenty seconds in observing time
will be considered by many of sufficient importance to take chances
on the cloudiness, stations will be selected in North Carolina for
that reason, although the probability for minimum cloudiness is
twice as good in Georgia and Alabama. The table shows that the
chances are only one to six against observers located in these States,
while near the coast they are about two to six against them. On
the whole, the general result is that observing in this region ought
to be successful, because the favorable chances for good weather

arranged in the Eleven Year Period, to show the Recurrence of Similar
Types during this Period.</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
An observer at the intersection of these cross-lines with the
central line will see the totality during the intervals given in the
table.</p>

<p>The mode of the formation of the shadow cones of the moon,
called the penumbra for the partial shadow and the umbra for the
total shadow, are well illustrated in general works on astronomy,
and good geometrical pictures of them can there be found, together
with much useful information regarding the subject of eclipses.
As we are here concerned chiefly with certain practical points
about the eclipse of 1900, it will be well for the reader to consult
such works for many details regarding the astronomical features
attending an eclipse of the sun which must now be omitted.</p>

<p>There are many existing theories to account for the phenomenon
of the sun’s bright appendage, called the corona, which is visible
only during eclipses, on account of the absorbing effects of
the earth’s atmosphere on its light. Is it electrical, or is it magnetic?
Is it composed of fine stuff ejected from the sun, or of
meteoric dust falling upon the sun? Is it merely an optical effect,
as some suppose, or is it a portion of the newly discovered radiant
matter streaming off to enormous distances into space? The answer
to these questions is eagerly sought through observation, photography,
and every other possible means, on the occasion of each
total eclipse.</p>

<p>The efforts of astronomers have thus far secured a series of
pictures of the solar corona, which, when compared together, show
very distinctly that the corona, as well as the spots, the protuberances,
and the faculæ, are going through a series of changes which
seem to repeat themselves in the so-called eleven-year period. It
has also been proven, with entire distinctness, that the earth’s
magnetic field, as marked by the changes in the intensity of the
magnetic elements, in the auroral displays, and the earth electric
currents show variations which synchronize closely with those observed
on the sun; also that the weather elements of pressure, temperature,
precipitation, and storm intensity all harmonize with the
solar and the earth’s magnetism in the same synchronism. All attempts
of scientists to detect any variations in the sunshine which
falls upon the tropics have been entirely futile; on the other hand,
it has been shown that the magnetic forces having the characteristics
just mentioned impinge upon the earth in a direction perpendicular
to the plane of the earth’s orbit, just as if the sun, being
a magnet, throws out a field of force to the surface of the earth,
which, by its variation depending upon the internal workings of
the sun, produces the changes just enumerated in the earth’s atmosphere
and in its magnetic field, also throughout the planetary system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
being, of course, strongest near the sun. The belief is gradually
growing among scientists that the earth, the sun, and the
planets are all magnetic bodies, and have these bonds of connection
between them in addition to the Newtonian gravitation. This is
a most fascinating field of research, and, though full of difficulties,
yet attracts the attention of many who are convinced that one of
the most pressing duties of the hour is to clear up the problems
connected with the transmission of energy from the sun to the
earth in other forms than the ordinary or sunlight radiation. It
is entirely probable that the secular variations of the weather
changes from year to year, and even from month to month, are
bound up with these solar forces, and that the solution of these
questions will carry with them much information of practical use
to civilized man.</p>

<p>The coronas of the past forty years are shown on <a href="#ip_6">Chart III</a>,
taken from the report of the eclipse of 1896 (August 9th), by A.
Hansky. It arranges the coronas in the eleven-year period so far
as the dates at which the eclipses occurred permit this to be done,
and by comparing them in vertical lines the similarity is at once
seen for the respective quarters of phases of the period. The forecast
there given for 1900 is seen to resemble 1867, 1878, and 1889,
but it differs in orientation from that on <a href="#ip_9">Chart IV</a>, which was prepared
by the author. The four coronas on the left in <a href="#ip_6">Chart III</a>
are taken at the sun-spot maximum, and the appearance is that
of total confusion in the
structure of the rays; the
second and the fourth columns
are for the sun’s
medium intensity at about
halfway between the maximum
and the minimum,
and they show a system of
polar rays taking on structural
form, the second column
being at a stage of diminishing
and the fourth
at one of increasing solar activity; the third column gives the
corona when the spots are at a minimum of frequency and the sun
is in a comparatively quiescent state, wherein the polar rifts are
very distinct and the equatorial wings or extensions greatly developed.</p>

  May 28, 1900.</span> <span class="notbold">E, earth’s axis; K, axis of ecliptic;

<p>The successful observation of a solar corona depends upon three
conditions: the selection of the instrument, its proper mounting,
and the photographic process, regarding each of which a few suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
will be made. The instruments are divided into two
classes, for visual and for photographic work. But in either case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the most important feature is the focal length or the size of the
telescope. Since the photographic image of the corona will not
bear magnifying without dispersing the available light, and thus
blurring out the details of the picture, which is the most important
feature to retain to the utmost, one can not use a short telescope
and at the same time a magnifying eyepiece to enlarge the image
by projection on a screen or on a photographic plate. The only
alternative in order to get an image of large diameter is to use a
long-focus lens. The effect of a difference of focus upon the image
of the corona is well shown on <a href="#ip_11">Chart V</a>, which gives a small corona
(1) taken with a four-foot lens (Barnard), (2) with a fifteen-foot
lens (Pickering), and (3) with a forty-foot lens (Schaeberle). The
diameter is proportional to the focal length, but the difference of
effect upon the details is very important. In the small picture the
details of the corona near the sun are completely lost in the general
light, while the coronal extensions from the middle latitudes
are seen at a great distance from the sun&mdash;as much as one million
miles; at the same time the polar rifts are distinctly marked, so
that the pole or central line from which they bend is readily located.
On the second picture the details of the polar rays are
better brought out, but the extensions are shortened. In the third
the region near the sun’s edge has many interesting details very
clearly defined, while all the extensions are gone. It is evident
that each lens has its advantage, according to the details sought,
and they ought all to be employed in the eclipse. The reproductions
on paper by no means do justice to the original negatives,
which make the distinctions even more pronounced than shown on
Chart V.</p>

  <div class="captionh"><span class="smcap">Chart V.&mdash;Relative Images of the Corona as taken with Telescopes ranging from
Forty Feet to Four Feet in Focal Length.</span></div></div>

<p>Some amateur observers have telescopes but no mountings suitable
for eclipse work, and many astronomical telescopes have good
equatorial mountings at home which are yet unavailable in the field
for lack of proper foundations and supports. The ordinary telescope
balanced near the center, with the eye end subject to all sorts
of motions which may happen through jarring and rough handling
in the hurry of shifting photographic plates, makes a very poor
eclipse apparatus. All telescopes of any length should be held
firmly at each end, so as to be perfectly steady, since the least
vibration ruins a coronal picture devoted to delicate photographic
effects. There are two ways of accomplishing this, and only two.
Dispensing with an equatorial mounting, the lens must be set permanently
on a base, and light reflected from a mirror must be
utilized, which shall be concentrated on a plate also placed on a
fixed base. This is the method employed by Schaeberle in Chili,
April 16, 1893, to obtain No. III of <a href="#ip_11">Chart V</a>. There is no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to it if an observer possesses a perfectly plane mirror, which it
is very difficult and also expensive to obtain; if the reflecting mirror
should be imperfect it would distort the image of the corona.
The second method, lacking a good mirror, is to mount the long-focus
lens in a tube and point it directly at the sun. A forty-foot
lens was thus mounted at Cape Ledo for December 22, 1889, and
its action was very satisfactory. Of course, it was a cumbersome
arrangement, and could not be employed by a small party. The
foundation for the mounting of the forty-foot tube consisted of
two casks filled with stones and cement, and set firmly in the
ground. These made two good piers, since the narrowing tops of
the casks held the bed plates of the telescope as in a vise. A triangle,
whose base was parallel to the earth’s axis and having the
telescope tube itself for the long side, was fitted with an extension
rod for adjustment in altitude on the third side, and the whole
was made to revolve on ball bearings. This triangular support
was rotated by a side rod of adjustable length, whose end terminated
in a sand piston working with a regulating valve. The sand
flowed out steadily like an hour-glass, and dropped the tube, keeping
it central on the sun. The image was made to follow accurately
for twenty minutes without tremor, all the time holding the
solar disk tangent to fixed lines. The principle of a revolving triangle
and a short piston, taking the place of an expensive reflecting
mirror with a delicate clockwork or one carrying a telescope
balanced on its center but subject to jars and side motions, is an
important assistance in field work on account of its ready adaptability
to all sorts of observations. Since time is limited, it is necessary
to provide all operations with automatic arrangements as far
as possible, by using such an apparatus as that described. What
can be applied successfully to a forty-foot lens can serve for shorter
telescopes. In combination with spectroscopes, polariscopes, and
special instruments for photographing, an immense amount of work
can be compressed into the few seconds allowed by mounting them
all on such a movable frame as the triangle. The old-fashioned
method of putting one observer to one telescope ought to be abandoned.
Of course, for a rising sun during the forenoon a modification
in the moving support must be employed. This should be
such as to cause the objective of the telescope to rise from the
ground toward the meridian, and it must be accomplished by attaching
a heavy weight which in sinking draws the tube upward.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chart VI.&mdash;Tracks of the Eight Total Eclipses of the Sun seen on the North
American Continent during the Nineteenth Century.</span></div></div>

<p>Of the two kinds of photographic plates, the wet and the dry,
the dry plates are much more convenient in the field, and are good
for certain purposes. The objections to them are that the rough
granulations of the gelatin film sometimes overpower the fine details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
of the corona itself; they burn out very near the disk by
over-exposure while the faint outer extensions are being taken.
Wet plates having the requisite quickness are harder to prepare,
but are smoother and hold the coronal rays better from the base
to the outer edge, and there is always plenty of time to give the
necessary exposure. The No. 26 Seed plate requires from 0.5 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
2.0 seconds only, generally one second being about right; the wet
plate will take the corona in eight seconds or less. The best time
of exposure should be tested on a bright star of about the second
magnitude, by trial before the eclipse. There is no rule about the
photographic focus, except to discover it by a series of exposures
at different distances near the supposed point. Eclipse work is a
practical matter, and many rough-and-ready methods must necessarily
be admitted. A good lens in a wooden light-tight tube, supported
at each end, having the motion of the sun, the photographic
focal plane carefully determined, the time exposures very short,
and, finally, exceedingly slow development of the picture after the
eclipse&mdash;these form the prime requisites. Expensive telescopes,
clockwork on heavy iron piers, reflecting mirrors, and such like
apparatus are not needed. Ingenuity in practical details, with
great anxiety about the essential matter of the light itself, is what
is needed for a successful eclipse expedition.</p>

<p>Those persons who have no telescope for viewing the sun, or
camera for photographing it, can yet see the corona to great advantage
by means of a good opera glass, and indeed this is really
the most satisfactory way to thoroughly enjoy the spectacle. The
object may be sketched on paper at once or from memory, and this
picture may well be of value to astronomy.</p>

<p>The tracks of the eight North American eclipses seen since
1800 are shown on <a href="#ip_12">Chart VI</a>. It is noted that three have paths
very similarly located, and that five run in directions about parallel
to one another, but almost at right angles to the first group. This
comprises the eclipse of November 30, 1834, duration two minutes;
August 7, 1869, two minutes and three quarters; July 29,
1878, two minutes and a half, which stretch from Alaska southeastward
in a fan-shape to the South Atlantic coast. The second
group contains the tracks June 16, 1806, four minutes and a half;
July 17, 1860, three minutes; January 11, 1880 thirty-two seconds;
January 1, 1889, two minutes and a quarter; and May 28,
1900, two minutes. These tracks all trend from southwest to
northeast, and cross the North American continent in different
latitudes, that of May 28, 1900, being the most southerly and of
rather short duration; lasting less than two minutes in the United
States.</p>

<p>The path of the total eclipse of May 28, 1900, after leaving the
United States, crosses the North Atlantic Ocean to Coimbra, Portugal,
and continues over North Africa to its end at the Red Sea.
Stations which are not situated on the path of the totality will see
the sun partially eclipsed, in proportion to the distance of the
locality from the central line to the northern or the southern limits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Thus New England, New York, the Ohio Valley, and the
southern Rocky Mountain districts will see the sun about nine
tenths covered; the Lake Region, the lower Missouri Valley, and
Southern California will see an eight-tenths eclipse; and the northern
Rocky Mountain region about six tenths or seven tenths. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
best way to view the partially eclipsed sun is to secure three strips
of thin colored glass, one and a half inch wide by five inches long&mdash;red,
blue, and green; bind them over the eye end of a good
opera glass, and adjust focus on the sun. This makes the light
safe for the eyes and brings out the spherical aspect of the sun’s
ball. The time of the eclipse can be read by interpolating within
the lines marked on <a href="#ip_16">Chart VII</a>.</p>

<p>No other eclipse track will occur in this country till June 8,
1918, when one of the first kind will pass from Oregon to Florida,
two minutes in duration. Another will occur in New England,
January 24, 1925. Eclipses seven minutes in duration will occur
in India in 1955, and in Africa in 1973, the longest for a thousand
years. The remoteness of the last two, both in time and place,
put them out of reckoning for most of us, but those of 1918 and
1925 give additional zest to the approaching eclipse of May 28th,
as affording further opportunity for confirming facts and noting
differences based upon the observations now made.</p>

<h2 title="The Most Expensive City in the World" id="most">THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITY IN THE WORLD.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Hon. BIRD S. COLER</span>,<br />

<span class="small">COMPTROLLER OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> annual expenses of the city of New York are larger than
those of any other municipality in the world, and the financial
transactions of a year represent the receipt and expenditure
of more than $200,000,000, counting temporary loans, sinking
funds, and bond issues. The gross budget of the city for 1899 was
$20,000,000 greater than the expenses of the city of London,
$18,000,000 in excess of the budget of Paris, and only $1,000,000
less than the combined expenditures of Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The expenses of New York last year for local purposes, exclusive
of bond issues, amounted to $19.56 per capita of an estimated
population of 3,500,000. The combined annual expenditures of
the six largest States in the Union are less than those of the city
of New York, and the financial transactions of the latter are equal
in amount to one seventh of those of the national Government.</p>

<p>The credit of the city, it may be stated at the outset, is second
only to that of the Federal Government, and the property owned
by the municipality, if sold at market value, would pay the entire
funded debt several times over.</p>

<p>The consolidation of ninety municipalities with the former city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
of New York was the culmination of a sentiment so fixed upon an
ideal that there had been little careful reckoning of the cost. The
municipality, by taking in the extra territory and population, doubled
its debt, added less than one fourth to its tangible assets, and
increased the cost of local government $15,000,000 a year. This
added cost is the price paid by the taxpayers for a sentiment and
for haste and carelessness in the work of completing consolidation.
The cost of government for the enlarged city was in 1899 approximately
$15,000,000 more than the combined expenditures of the
various municipalities for the last year of their separate existence.
This increase was excessive and altogether unnecessary to the maintenance
of thorough and progressive government.</p>

<p>The present charter of the city is supposed to provide a large
measure of home rule, yet the salary of almost every officer and
employee, from the mayor to the doormen of the police stations,
is fixed by act of the State Legislature. The former cities of New
York and Brooklyn had been so long regulated and governed from
Albany that the commissioners who drafted the charter evidently
overlooked the fact that a municipality might be trusted to regulate
the pay of its own employees. To-day the pay of the school-teachers,
policemen, firemen, heads of departments, and chiefs of
bureaus is fixed at Albany, where the representatives of the city are
in the minority. When the charter was prepared the commissioners
agreed that taxation and salaries must be equalized. The members
differed in their views on many questions, but they evidently
agreed that the way to equalize salaries was to increase the lowest
to equal the highest.</p>

<p>In extending the benefits of a great corporate government to
the many suburban communities included in the consolidation a
uniformed policeman, or five or ten of them, at fourteen hundred
dollars a year took the place of a town marshal or constable at three
hundred dollars a year, and high-priced trained firemen were substituted
for unpaid volunteers. This method of equalizing salaries
was extended to every section of the city and to every branch of
the government. No attempt, apparently, was made to devise
some system that would adjust salaries in various localities to local
conditions and cost of living. The sentiment in favor of a great
city was not disposed to quibble when the cost of maintaining the
visible form of municipal government was increased fivefold in
much of the outlying territory.</p>

<p>Aside from the extension of high-priced municipal service
throughout the great area of the consolidated city, many useless
offices were created and many salaries fixed at excessive figures.
Authority was too much divided. The borough system is expensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and so far useless. The entire charter is a series of compromises,
and every compromise on a salary was at the maximum rate.</p>

<p>This method of arranging the expenses of the greater city increased
the cost of government beyond the highest estimates of
those who had advocated consolidation. The initial cost was further
increased by reason of the fact that no precautions were taken
to prevent the various municipalities to be united from increasing
their bonded and contract indebtedness during the last year of their
separate existence. The result of that oversight was that every
municipality, the former city of New York included, issued bonds
and entered upon contracts with somewhat reckless disregard of the
future. In this way a heavy burden of unnecessary expense
was added to the legitimate account charged against the consolidated
city.</p>

<p>Greater New York began business in a condition of apparent
bankruptcy, because the debts exceeded the constitutional limitation
of ten per cent of the assessed value of taxable real estate.
To overcome this and to meet the extra expense of government
by the new system it was necessary to greatly increase the tax rate.</p>

<p>The financial condition of New York on January 1, 1900, was
satisfactory except in the matter of current expenses. The gross
accepted funded debt on that date was $358,104,307.11, against
which there was a sinking fund of $105,435,871.70, leaving a net
funded debt of $252,668,435.41. Considered in connection with
the wealth of the city, this debt is not excessive. The city of
Paris, with smaller available resources, has a debt in excess of
$500,000,000. The gross expenditures of the city during 1899,
exclusive of permanent improvements, paid for from the proceeds
of bonds, were $93,520,082.03, and in 1900 the expenses will be
some $3,000,000 less.</p>

<p>The total receipts of the city for the same period, from all
sources and for all purposes, were approximately $108,000,000.
The income was derived from three general sources, taxation yielding
$84,000,000. The budget, which represents the money to be
raised by taxation, was reduced $9,000,000 by income known as
the general fund. The chief items of this were: Excise taxes,
$3,600,000; school money from the State, $1,280,883.45; fees of
various county and city offices, $246,576.65; interest on taxes
and assessments, $979,185.35; and unexpended appropriations,
$1,356,786.57.</p>

<p>Aside from the revenues classed as the general fund, New York
has no income from any source that can be applied to current
expenses for the reduction of taxation. The immensely valuable
franchises heretofore granted to private corporations yield a revenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
to the city that is insignificant, the total collected rarely exceeding
$300,000 a year.</p>

<p>The gradual reduction of the city debt, except as it is maintained
or increased by additional bond issues, is amply provided
for by a steadily increasing and protected sinking fund. The total
receipts of this fund in 1899 were $15,601,492.50. The Croton
water rents, amounting last year to $4,590,502.55, are applied to
this fund, as well as the dock and slip rents of $2,362,421.14.
Some of the other chief items of this fund are: Revenue from
investments, $3,573,519.34; ferry rents, $370,776; market rents,
$251,500; interest on deposits, $520,526; installments included in
the budget, $2,633,110.</p>

<p>More, than $1,000,000 is derived annually from miscellaneous
sources, including the sale of various odds and ends of property.
The total interest charges on bonds in 1899 amounted to
$11,275,822, leaving more than $4,000,000 of the sinking-fund
income applicable to reduction of the funded debt.</p>

<p>Two features of the financial system of New York that increase
expenditures can and should be changed. Taxes are now collected
in the last quarter of the year upon an assessment made twelve
months before. This compels the city to borrow large sums of
money to meet current expenses. In 1899 the city borrowed, in
anticipation of taxes, the sum of $48,027,450, on which the interest
amounted to $755,704. If the taxes were collected during the
first quarter of the year, the city would not only save this three
quarters of a million dollars interest on temporary loans, but for
six or seven months would have large cash balances in depository
banks earning two per cent. This change would be worth approximately
$1,500,000 a year to the treasury, but it must be made by
degrees in order that taxes shall not be collected twice in a twelve-month.</p>

<p>Under the present constitutional restriction upon the borrowing
capacity of the city, New York is placed in the contradictory
position of getting richer and poorer at the same time and by the
same process. The restriction of the debt limit to ten per cent
of the taxable real estate is arbitrary, and makes no distinction of
obligations. Every time the city acquires additional real estate
for parks, docks, schoolhouses, or any other purpose its borrowing
capacity and income from taxation are reduced, because the
property acquired no longer yields a tax and it is not counted in
the valuation upon which the debt limit is fixed. This is the
most illogical and unbusinesslike feature of the present financial
system.</p>

<p>The piers owned by the city are profitable investments, yielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
a revenue in excess of interest and sinking fund for the bonds issued;
yet if we should acquire $100,000,000 of additional water front
now owned by private parties the borrowing capacity of the municipality
would be reduced $10,000,000, and the income would suffer
the amount of taxes on the land acquired. There should be
adopted a constitutional amendment that would separate debts incurred
for revenue-yielding investments, such as docks and waterworks,
from those created for general public improvements. The
former should not be a charge against the borrowing capacity of
the city.</p>

<p>The budget of the city for 1900 is $90,778,972.48, which
will be reduced $9,000,000 by the general fund, leaving some
$82,000,000 to be raised by taxation. The magnitude of this outlay
for current expenses may be better understood by comparison
with the expenditures of other large cities. The approximate
current expenses of London last year were $73,000,000; of Paris,
$75,000,000; of Berlin, $23,347,600; of Boston, $35,454,588; of
Chicago, $32,034,008; of Philadelphia, $27,075,014.</p>

<p>In 1899 the State tax paid by the city of New York amounted
to $6,275,659, or nearly seventy per cent of the whole; interest on
bonds absorbed $11,275,822, leaving $75,813,644 as the actual cost
of the current expenses of local government. The gross budget
represented a per-capita tax of $24.62 on 3,500,000 inhabitants,
of which $19.56 was for local expenses. Of this enormous expenditure
more than $35,000,000 is paid out in salaries and wages
to 37,000 officers and employees. The Police Department cost
$12,000,000 a year, of which $10,700,000 is for salaries. New
York has 6,400 policemen. Philadelphia has 2,600, and the annual
cost of the department in that city is $3,100,000 a year&mdash;much
lower in proportion than that of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The salaries and wages paid to all regular department employees,
including policemen, firemen, street cleaners, and dock
builders, are higher than those paid in any other city in the world,
and almost without exception the rate has been fixed by act of the
State Legislature, and not by the local authorities. In the matter
of fixing the pay of officers and employees the city of New York
has never known any degree of home rule.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the city in wealth and population has always
operated against economy in local government. There has existed,
apparently, an overwhelming popular sentiment in the city, as well
as throughout the State, that such a great municipality should pay
the maximum price for everything it might require. If this sentiment
had been satisfied by the payment of high salaries and
wages it might have been excusable from some points of view; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
it was not, and the demand for more money from the public treasury
has extended to every class of expenditure.</p>

<p>The city of New York is a purchaser in the open market of
supplies exceeding in value $5,000,000 a year. This figure applies
only to articles purchased without competitive bidding. There is
in the charter a provision that all purchases of supplies and labor
in excess of $1,000 shall be made by open competitive bidding.
This leaves a wide field for fraud and favoritism, and it is an easy
matter to evade the spirit and letter of the law relating to competition.
If a department requires material and supplies amounting
to $10,000, or even $50,000, it is often possible to make the
purchases in lots of less than $1,000 from day to day, and thereby
obey the letter of the law while permitting the grossest frauds
against the city treasury.</p>

<p>Under the system that has grown up, protected by this imperfect
legal restriction and opinions and decisions to the effect that
the city has no defense against excessive claims unless fraud and
conspiracy can be proved, robbery of the public treasury has not
only been legalized, it has been made respectable. The comptroller,
who is by law the auditor of accounts, may be able to show
that the city has been charged double or treble the market rate for
supplies purchased, yet under the legal opinions and decisions that
have prevailed for two years he is not permitted to interpose any
defense to an action to recover unless he can prove that there was
a conspiracy or agreement to defraud. In the very nature of
things it is next to impossible to secure legal evidence of such
agreements; therefore the city has been robbed with impunity.
The methods of the Tweed ring have long been out of date in the
city of New York, and fraud upon the public treasury has become
a respectable calling.</p>

<p>It is not easy&mdash;in fact, not possible&mdash;to determine accurately
how much the expenses of the city have been increased in recent
years by the lax interpretation of an imperfect law and the tolerance
of a public sentiment that demands proof of crime on a large
scale before becoming aroused to a condition of effective action. It
is safe to say, however, that a perfect system of buying in the open
market at the lowest prices obtainable, if honestly enforced, would
save to the taxpayers more than $1,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Honest and intelligent administration in every department of
the city government would reduce expenditures, but the extent of
the reduction that might be made would depend largely upon the
proper amendment of certain laws, and to an even greater extent
upon the development of a thoroughly informed public sentiment
that would sustain retrenchment and economy. The expenses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the city are far greater than they should be, but it is going to be
a difficult matter to make even an appreciable beginning in economy
so long as the State Legislature is permitted to exercise practically
unlimited power to regulate the financial affairs of the
municipality. Persons and corporations, be they honest or corrupt,
when they seek to obtain money from the city treasury for
any purpose, are going to proceed along the line of least resistance,
and the smooth and open way has long been the Legislature at
Albany. Every session of that body adds something to the expenses
of the city, and it is a short and dull one that does not add
many thousands of dollars to the burden of the New York taxpayers.</p>

<p>The revenues of the municipality are so small in comparison
with what they should be that it is a difficult matter to find any
excuse for the theory of government that existed in the days when
perpetual franchises were given away. It is small consolation that
the policy of municipal ownership is at last to prevail after so much
of the public property has passed into the possession of private corporations.
If all the outstanding franchises that were the property
of the people had been sold on short terms for percentages even
as large as have been fixed in recent cases, the city to-day would
drive from that source an annual revenue of more than $5,000,000,
instead of the paltry $300,000 now collected.</p>

<p>The mistakes of the past, however, are beyond undoing, and
the taxpayers must look to the future for relief from the burdens
they bear. They are paying now $15,000,000 a year for the sentiment
that demanded a city great in all save honesty and political
wisdom. Consolidation in fact as well as sentiment must result
to prove the material advantage of the arrangement. Public opinion
and politicians must realize sooner or later that income and
expenses are to be adjusted the one to the other upon sound and
enduring principles of business, honesty, and intelligence. There
must be a union of public and political interests. Every section of
the great city must be brought into close touch with every other
section by cheap and rapid transit.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the future are greater than the dreams of
to-day, but new policies and new methods must and will prevail.
The development of Greater New York must not be hampered by a
financial system antiquated and imperfect. The city should have
power to develop its material resources into revenue-yielding improvements,
and then, with honest and intelligent government,
the burden of taxation will be reduced to a minimum, and the
ideal of the grandest municipality in the world will have been
achieved.</p>

<h2 title="A Bubble-blowing Insect" id="bubble">A BUBBLE-BLOWING INSECT.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Prof. E.&nbsp;S. MORSE.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Many</span> years ago, while preparing an elementary book on zoölogy,
I had occasion to make a drawing of the little insect
which is found on grass and other plants immersed in flecks of
froth. This substance is commonly known as frog spittle or cuckoo
spit, and, being found in the spring, is known in France as “spring
froth.”</p>

<p>Works on entomology gave the general statement that this
insect emitted the frothy mass from its body. Curious to ascertain
what peculiar gas-secreting apparatus was contained within its
anatomy, I dissected a number of specimens, without finding a trace
of any structure that could produce from within the body a single
bubble of air. On the contrary, I found that the little insect
emitted a clear, somewhat viscid fluid, and by means of appendages
at the extreme tip of its tail secured a moiety of air by grasping it,
so to speak, and then instantly releasing it as a bubble in the fluid
it had secreted. At the time of this observation&mdash;twenty-five years
ago&mdash;I supposed that entomologists were familiar with this fact,
but, on the appearance of my little book, I received a letter from
the late Dr. Hermann Hagen, the distinguished entomologist, stating
that he had ransacked his library and failed to find any reference
of the nature of my statement. Doubtless the whole history
of this insect has since been published, but a somewhat superficial
survey of the literature has failed to reveal any reference to the
matter. In this connection it is interesting to observe how often
the more easily accessible facts of Nature escape the special student.
The history of science is replete with such instances. One can
hardly take up any subject connected with the life history of animals
without finding lacunæ which ought to have been filled long
ago. The facts in regard to the ossification of the hyoid bones
in man is a case in point. The persistence of these erroneous concepts
or half-truths comes about by the acceptance at the outset
of some fairly trustworthy account by an authority on the subject,
and ever after the statements are copied without a doubt being
expressed as to their accuracy.</p>

<p>If we look over the literature of the subject under discussion,
we find that in nearly every case the statement in regard to the
spit-insect conveys the idea that the creature secretes the froth in
which it is immersed. Beginning with De Geer in the last century,
we quote as follows: “One may see coming out of the hinder
part of its body a little ball of liquid, which it causes to slip along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
bending it under its body. Beginning again the same movements,
it is not long in producing a second globule of liquid, filled with air
like the first, which it places side by side with and close to the preceding
one, and continues the same operation as long as there remains
any sap in its body.” Kirby and Spence, in their Entomology,
describe “the white froth often observed on rose bushes and other
shrubs and plants, called by the vulgar ‘frog spittle,’ but which
if examined will be found to envelop the larva of a small hemipterous
larva (<i>Aphrophora spumaria</i>), from whose anus it exudes.”
In Westwood’s Insects we find the following statement: “One of
the best-known insects in the family is the <i>Aphrophora spumaria</i>,
a species of small size which frequents garden plants, the larva and
pupa investing themselves with a frothy excrementitious secretion
which has given rise to various fancies. A species of <i>Aphrophora</i>
is also found in great quantities upon trees in Madagascar, the
larva of which has the power of emitting a considerable quantity
of clear water, especially in the middle of the day, when the heat
is greatest.” Here the statement is definitely made that the froth
is excrementitious, and the Madagascar insect is shown to be different
from <i>Aphrophora</i> in that it exudes a clear water. In Dr. Harris’s
Treatise on some of the Insects Injurious to Vegetation, of
Massachusetts, we find a most definite statement as to the origin
and nature of this froth. He says: “Here may be arranged the
singular insects, called frog hoppers (<i>Cercopididæ</i>), which pass their
whole lives on plants, on the stems of which their eggs are laid in
the autumn. The following summer they are hatched, and the
young immediately perforate the bark with their beaks and begin
to imbibe the sap. They take in such quantities of this that it
oozes out of their bodies continually in the form of little bubbles,
which soon completely cover up the insects.” In Dr. Packard’s
admirable Guide to the Study of Insects the statement is made that
“<i>Helochara</i> and <i>Aphrophora</i>, while in the larva state, suck the sap
of grasses and emit a great quantity of froth, or in some cases a
clear liquid, which in the former case envelops the body and thus
conceals it from sight. It is then vulgarly called ‘toad’s spittle.’”</p>

<p>In other accounts it is stated that the larvæ live covered by
masses of froth which the insects produce by expelling from their
beak the juices drawn out of the tree.</p>

<p>The above extracts are sufficient to indicate the common belief
among entomologists that the insect in some way emits this froth
from the body. A most cursory examination of the creature, however,
shows that its only secretion is a clear fluid.</p>

<p>The so-called frog spittle or cuckoo spit (<a href="#ip_25">Fig. 1</a>) appears as little
flecks of froth on grass, buttercups, and many other plants during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the early summer. These flecks of froth may be found very commonly
at the junction of the leaf with the stem. Immersed in this
froth is found a little green insect, sometimes two or three of them,
concealed by the same moist covering. This little
creature represents the early stage of an insect
which in its full growth still lives upon grass, and
is easily recognized by its triangular shape and its
ability of jumping like a grasshopper. There are
a number of species; the one living on grass apparently
confines itself to the grass alone, though
I have seen one species that frequents a number
of different plants. A species found on the white
pine is dark brown in color, and the froth in which
it is found not only hangs pendent from the
branch, but the lower portion appears as a large
drop of clear water.</p>

Stages in the Production of Froth.</span></div></div>

<p>Let one provide himself with a good hand lens,
a bit of glass (a watch crystal is especially suitable
for this purpose), and a common camel’s-hair
brush, and he is ready to make a preliminary
study of <i>Aphrophora</i>. The brush is convenient
for easily removing the insect from the froth
which invests it. If the insect is cleared from the
mass of froth, it will crawl quite rapidly along the
stem of the plant, stopping at times to pierce the
stem for the purpose of sucking the juices within,
and finally settling down in earnest, evidently exerting
some force in thrusting its piercing apparatus
through the outer layers, as shown by the
firm way in which it clutches the stem with its
legs. After sucking for some time, a clear fluid is
seen to slowly exude from the posterior end of the
abdomen, flowing over the body first and gradually filling up the
spaces between the legs and the lower part of the body and the stem
upon which it rests (<a href="#ip_26">Fig. 2</a>). During all this time not a trace of an
air bubble appears; simply a clear, slightly viscid fluid is exuded,
and this is the only matter that escapes from the insect. In other
words, its secretion of clear fluid is precisely like that of the Madagascar
species referred to by Westwood and others.</p>

<p>This state of partial immersion continues for half an hour or
more. During this time, and even when the insect is roaming up
and down the grass or twig, the posterior segments of the abdomen
are extended at intervals, the abdomen turning upward at the
same time. It is a kind of reaching-up movement, but whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
this action accompanies a discharge of fluid or is an attempt at
reaching for air I have not ascertained. Suddenly the insect begins
to make bubbles by turning its tail out of the fluid, opening the
posterior segment, which
appears like claspers, and
grasping a moiety of air,
then turning the tail
down into the fluid and
instantly allowing the inclosed
air to escape (<a href="#ip_26b">Fig. 3</a>).
These movements go
on at the rate of seventy
or eighty times a minute.
At the outset the
tail is moved alternately
to the right and left in
perfect rhythm, so that
the bubbles are distributed
on both sides of
the body, and these are
crowded toward the head
till the entire fluid is
filled with bubbles, and
the froth thus made runs
over the back and around
the stem (<a href="#ip_26c">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Even when partially
buried in these bubbles
the tail is oscillated
to the right and left,
though when completely
immersed the tail is only occasionally thrust out for air which is
allowed to escape in the mass apparently without the right-and-left
movement, though of this I am not sure. It is interesting to
observe that in half a minute some thirty or forty bubbles are
made in this way&mdash;a bulk of air two or three times exceeding the
bulk of the body&mdash;without the slightest diminution in the size of
the body.</p>

<p>If the insect is allowed to become dry, by resting it upon a piece
of blotting paper, and is then placed upon a piece of glass and a
drop of clear saliva be allowed to fall upon it, it proceeds to fill up
this fluid with bubbles in precisely the same manner as it did
with its own watery secretion. It is quite difficult to divest the
creature of the bubbles of air which adhere to the spaces between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the legs and the segments on the underside of the body. It
may be readily done, however, by immersing it in clear water
and manipulating it with a brush. If now it is again dried and
placed on the glass it will slowly secrete what spare fluid it has in
its body, but not the minutest bubble of air is seen to escape.
These experiments should be made on glass, for then one may get
transmitted light, and the highly refractive outlines of the air
bubbles are more quickly detected. Using a higher power with a
live cell, new features may be observed. Confining the insect in
this way, inclosed in a drop of water, a very clear proof is offered
that it gets all the air for its froth in the way I have described.
So long as the insect remains surrounded by water not the minutest
bubble of air is seen to escape from the body. During this immersion
the creature is incessantly struggling to reach the edge
of the drop, and no sooner has this been accomplished than it
thrusts out its tail and begins the clutching of air and the making
of bubbles. The bubbles, however, disappear as soon as made, as
the clear water will not preserve them. As the water becomes
slightly viscid from the insect’s own secretions, the bubbles remain
for a longer time. A bubble will be partially released and then
held, or even partially withdrawn, between the claspers.</p>

under slight pressure.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>The claspers seem to be the tergal portions of the ninth segment.
On the sides of the seventh and eighth segments may be
clearly seen leaflike appendages, which are possibly branchial in
their nature (<a href="#ip_27">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#ip_27b">6</a>). They are extremely tenuous, and
appear like clusters of filaments, slightly adhering together and
forming lamellate appendages similar to the gill-like appendages
seen in the early stages of <i>Potamanthus</i>, a neuropterous insect, not,
however, having the definiteness of these structures. While in
<i>Potamanthus</i> one may easily trace the ramifications of the tracheal
system, I have not been able to detect a similar connection with
these appendages in <i>Aphrophora</i>. Certainly the insect does not
depend upon these structures for respiration, as when the creature
is perfectly dry it seems to suffer no immediate inconvenience, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
will crawl about the table or even on the dusty floor and live for
an hour or two in this condition. The usually glabrous surface
of the body, however, becomes shriveled after a while. On the
other hand, it immediately sinks in water, and will live for some
time immersed in this way, and this leads me to believe that the
appendages above described may perform a slight respiratory function.
The fact that the insect immediately sinks may be cited as
an additional evidence that it does not emit air.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that regarding this stage of <i>Aphrophora</i>
as an aquatic stage, since it lives immersed in fluid, we have
the same behavior that we observe in the aquatic stages of other
<i>Hemiptera</i>, as well as in insects of other orders. The great water
beetle <i>Hydrophilus</i> has an aquatic larva. Myall, quoting Lyonet,
says: “They never remain long at the bottom of the water; air is
necessary for them, and this they take in by the tail, which they
raise from time to time to the surface of the water.” In the larva
of <i>Dysticus</i>, another water beetle, the only functional spiracles are
the last pair, opening at the tail. The little oval beetles, known
as whirligigs, from their rapid whirling motion, when swimming
on the surface of the water carry down a bubble of air on the end
of the abdomen, and when this has been exhausted in the process
of respiration rise to the surface for a fresh bubble. The larvæ
of some forms are furnished on each side with long respiratory
filaments.</p>

<p>A number of neuropterous insects whose early stages are passed
in the water are furnished with branchial tracheæ or false gills.
These consist of filaments springing from the sides of the abdominal
segments. In the early stages of certain dragon flies the rectum
supports epithelial folds which are filled with fine tubes from the
tracheal system. Among certain aquatic insects belonging to the
order of <i>Hemiptera</i> the creatures reach out the hinder portion of the
body to secure air. Dr. Myall, in his very interesting book on the
Natural History of Aquatic Insects, says: “A <i>Nepa</i> or a <i>Ranatra</i>
may sometimes be seen to creep backward along a submerged weed
until the tip of its breathing tube breaks the surface of the water.”</p>

<p>The <i>Aphrophora</i> while immersed in the watery fluid, whether
secreted by itself or consisting of clear water which has been supplied
to it, reaches out for air in a precisely similar manner. Primarily
the froth made by this insect not only keeps the body moist,
but acts as a protection against its enemies.</p>

<p>A number of individuals may often be found in one fleck of
froth, and they are entirely hidden from sight while immersed
in this way. The viscid character of the fluid secreted insures
the retention of the air the insect collects in the form of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
bubbles. This peculiar feature must have been a secondary acquisition.
The bubbles not only surround the insect and the stem
upon which it rests, but flows in a continuous sheet between the
ventral plates of the abdomen, and the insect probably utilizes
this air in the manner of other air-breathing aquatic larvæ&mdash;namely,
through its spiracles. As many aquatic larvæ respire in
two ways, either inhaling air through the spiracles or by means
of branchial leaflets, so <i>Aphrophora</i> may likewise utilize its branchial
tufts for the same purpose. For this reason we can understand
how each fresh bubble added to the mass may aërate the
fluid, so to speak, and thus insure at intervals a fresh supply of
oxygen.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By N.&nbsp;S. Shaler</span>,<br />

<span class="small">DEAN OF THE SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> admirable conduct of the negro during the civil war made
it seem possible to have the readjustment of his relations on
the basis of freedom brought about with a minimum of friction.
As a whole, the former slaves had stayed on the land where they
belonged. Many of those who had wandered, moved by the homing
instinct so strong in their race, found their way back to their
accustomed places. The bonds of mutual interest and old affections
were enough, had the situation been left without outside disturbance,
to have made the transition natural and easy. It is true
that the negro, with his scant wage paid in supplies, would not
have advanced very far in the ways of freedom. He would have
been hardly better than the middle-age serf bound to his field. It
would, however, have been better to begin with a minimum of
liberty, with provision for schooling and a franchise based on
education. But this was not to be. Political ends and the popular
misconception of the negroes as beings who differ from ourselves
only in the color of their skin and in the kink of their hair
led to their immediate enfranchisement and to the disenfranchisement
of their masters. This was attended by an invasion into the
South of the worst political rabble that has ever cursed the land.
There were good and true men among the carpet-baggers, but as a
lot they were of a badness such as the world has not known since
captured provinces were dealt out to the political gamblers of
Rome.</p>

<p>The effect of the carpet-bag period on the negroes was to raise
their expectations of fortune to the highest point, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
cast them down. Those of the poorest imaginations looked for
forty acres of land and a mule. In the resulting political corruption
the native whites and blacks endured even greater losses than
the war had inflicted, the most grievous being a great unsettling
of the relations between the races. The way in which the white
men of the better sort met this trial is fit to be compared with the
best political achievements of their folk. Gradually, on the whole
without violence, for they had to abstain from that, working within
the limits of the Constitution to which they had been forced to
trust for their remedies, they rewon control of their wasted communities,
and brought them back to civilized order. There was a
share of terrorism and shame from such devices as tissue ballots to
lessen the dignity of this remarkable work, yet it remains a great
achievement&mdash;one that goes far to redeem the folly of the secession
movement. The full significance of this action is yet to be
comprehended.</p>

<p>The overthrow of the carpet-bag governments, quietly yet effectively
accomplished, removed the only danger of war between
the blacks and whites. We can not well imagine another crisis so
likely to bring about a conflict of that kind. The blacks were
driven from power. Their desperate leaders would willingly have
led them to fight, but the allegiance to the ancient masters was
too strong, their trust in the carpet-bagger, for all his affectation
of love, too slight to set them on that way. The negro fell back
as near as might be to the place he held at the close of the war.
His position was thereafter worse than it was at that station in his
history, for the confidence and affection which the behavior of their
servants during the rebellion had inspired was replaced in the mind
of the dominant race by an abiding sense of the iniquities in which
the ex-slaves had shared. Thereafter, and to this day, the black
man is looked upon as a political enemy, who has to be watched
lest he will again win a chance to control the state. In the greater
part of the South this fear is passing away. In several States new
laws concerning the franchise have made it practically impossible
for the negro vote to be a source of danger for some time to come&mdash;until,
indeed, the negro is better educated and has property. There
is a share of iniquity in these laws, as there is apt to be in all
actions relating to a situation that rests on ancient evils, but their
effect is better than that of terrorism and tissue ballots which it
replaces. They will afford time for the new adjustments to be
effected.</p>

<p>In considering the present conditions of the negro, we may
first note the important fact that he is hard at work. The production
of the South clearly shows that the sometime slaves, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
rather their children, are laboring even more effectively than they
did in the time of legal servitude. This disposes of the notion
that the blacks will not work without other compulsion than those
needs which bend the backs of his white brethren. It is evident
that the generation born since the war is laborious and productive
up to, if not beyond, the average of men. It is also plain that
they are fitted for a rather wider range of employment than they
were accustomed to follow as slaves. The negro has proved himself
well adapted for labor in mines and about furnaces&mdash;in all
places, indeed, where strength and a moderate share of intelligence
are required. The fear that he would desert the land and flock
to the cities has not been justified. He appears less disposed to
yield to the temptations of the great towns than the whites. The
first rage of the freed people for schooling seems to have passed.
A good many of them are getting the rudiments of an education,
some few a larger culture, but there appears to be danger that the
folk may lapse into indifference concerning all training that is not
immediately profitable.</p>

<p>As to the moral condition of the negroes, there appears to be
good reason for believing that it is now in the way of betterment.
Little as they were disturbed in their conduct by the sudden change
in their apparent place in the world, they were for a time somewhat
shaken as regards the limits of their rights. So far as I
have been able to learn, they are much less given to stealing than
they were just after they were freed, or even as they were as slaves.
Their marital relations, though leaving much still to be desired,
are improving, as is all that relates to the care of their children.
Most important is the fact that loose relations between white men
and negro women have in great measure ceased, so that the unhappy
mixture of the races, which has been the curse of tropical
states, is apparently not likely to prove serious.</p>

<p>Although the negro is not rapidly gaining property, he is
making a steadfast advance in that direction. The money sense
in all that relates to capital he, with a few exceptions, is yet to
acquire. This part of his task is certain to be difficult to him,
as it is to all peoples who are in the earlier stages of civilized
thought. The experiment of the Freedman’s Bank, by which
many suffered at the hands of designing white people, has left
a bad impression upon the minds of the negroes. Where they
save, they commonly hoard their store. As yet they have not
become accustomed to associative action. They rarely enter into
any kind of partnership. In this indisposition to attain the advantages
of mutual support we have another evidence of the primitive
condition of the folk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Before endeavoring to go further with this account of the present
state of the negroes of this country, it is well to note the fact
that while much has been done to blend the original diversities of
their stock, these differences have by no means passed away. The
seekers after slaves in Africa were not choice as to their purchases
or captures; they reckoned as black if he were no darker than
brown, and they were not at all careful to see that his hair was
kinky. Thus it came about that from the wide ethnic range of
the Dark Continent there came to us a great variety of people&mdash;a
much more diverse population than we have received from Europe.
It might be supposed that the conditions of slavery would quickly
have effaced these differences, but even in that state there was
choice in mating, and certain stocks have such prepotency that a
small share of their blood stamps those who have it in a definite
manner. The result is that, under the mask of a common dark,
though really very variedly tinted skin, we have an exceeding
diversity of race and quality.</p>

<p>It is discreditable to our students of anthropology that as yet
there has been no considerable effort made to determine the varieties
which exist in our negro population or the source of their
peculiarities in the tribes whence they come. In a small way, for
many years, on numerous journeys in the South, I have endeavored
to classify the blacks I have met. For a long time I kept
these results in a roughly tabulated form. Although such observations,
including no measurements and giving only eye impressions
of the general form, can have no determinable value, they
may, in the absence of better work, deserve consideration. The
result of this rough inspection of many thousand of these peoples
in nearly every State in the South has been to indicate that there
are several, probably more than six, groups of so-called negroes
which represent original differences of stock or the mixed product
of their union. The more characteristic of these I will now briefly
describe.</p>

<p>For convenience I will first note those who are termed mulattoes,
in which there is an evident mixture of white blood. Such
admixture seems to be distinctly traceable if it amounts to as little
as one eighth; it is said that one sixteenth of negro blood, or less,
will be revealed on close study of the hair and skin. The proportion
of the negroes in our Southern States who have white
ancestry in any degree does not, in my opinion, exceed one tenth,
and may be as small as one twentieth of the whole number. Judging
only by the hue of the skin, the observer will be likely to make
the proportion larger, for the reason that he will include many
persons who, because they come from stocks that were not blackskinned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
appear at first sight to be mulattoes of some degree.
These Eu-Africans, as we may term them&mdash;imitating in the term
the useful word Eurasian, which is applied to the mixture of European
and Asiatic people in India&mdash;are in appearance exceedingly
diverse, the variety being caused by the varying share of the blood
of the two races, as well as by the diversities of the stocks to which
the parents belong.</p>

<p>Besides the mixture of the European and black, we have another
less well known but not uncommon between the negro and
the Indian. This is often met with among the remnants of the
Indian tribes in all the eastern part of the United States. The
two groups of primitive people appear to have found their despised
lot a basis for a closer union. The dark skin of the Algonkins,
however, makes the remnants of that people appear to have more
black blood than they really possess. Not only did stray negroes
resort to the Indian settlements, but some of the tribes owned
many slaves. The result is that in many parts of this country, but
particularly in Virginia, the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia, the
attentive observer often will note the Indian’s features stamped
on those of the African.</p>

<p>Coming to the diversities of the stock among the pure Africans,
we may first note the type which, in the rough judgment of the
public, is the real or Guinea negro. That he is so taken is doubtless
because he is the most distinctly characterized of all black people.
The men of this well-known group are generally burly fellows,
attaining at a relatively early age a massive trunk and strong
thighs; they have thick necks and small though variedly shaped
heads. The bridge of the nose is low, and the jaws protruding.
The face, though distinctly of a low type, very often has a very
charming expression&mdash;one in which the human look is blended with
a remnant of the ancient animal who had not yet come to the
careful stage of life. The women of this group are well made,
but commonly less so than the men. In general form the two sexes
of the group are much alike, a feature which also indicates an essentially
low station. These people of the Guinea type form perhaps
one half of the Southern negroes.</p>

<p>Along with the Guinea type goes another much rarer, which
at first sight might by the careless observer be confounded with
the lower group. The only common features are the burly form
of both, the deep-black hue, and the general form of the features.
The men we are now considering have a higher and in every way
better head. Their foreheads are fuller, and the expression of the
face, to my view, quite other than that of the Guinea men. In
place of the sly, evasive child-animal look of the lower creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
this fellow has rather a lordly port, the expression of a vigorous,
brave, alert man. This, which I am disposed to term the Zulu
type, from the resemblance to that people, is on many accounts
the most interesting of all the groups we have to consider. My
idea that it may have come from the above-named tribe is based
on an acquaintance with a party of southern Africans who some
forty years ago were brought to this country by a showman. I
came to know them well. They were attractive fellows, of the
same quality as certain blacks I had known in Kentucky. When
I saw these strangers I perceived their likeness to certain able
blacks whose features and quality had made impressions on my
mind that remain clear to the present day. It is likely that this
element of the negro people I have termed Zulu is not of any one
tribe; it may be of several diverse stocks with no other common
quality than that which vigor gives. They may, in part, be from
Bangora tribes of the Congo Valley, or even Soudanese. The proportion
of this group to the whole is small; because it merges into
the other it can not well be estimated. I find that I have reckoned
it in my notes as one twentieth of the whole black population.</p>

<p>Set over against these robust blacks, but also of high quality,
is a group less distinctly limited, which has for its characteristics a
rather tall, lean form, a slender neck, a high head, and a thin face,
usually with a nose of better form than is commonly found, sometimes
approaching the aquiline. The skin of these people is often
as black as that of the Guinea folk, yet it is of another hue&mdash;a
deader black, perhaps due to some difference in the skin glands.
Usually, however, there is a trace of brown in the complexion.
Now and then the relative straightness of the hair and their facial
profiles suggest that the peculiarity of this people is due to an
admixture of Semitic (probably Arabian) blood. Negroes of this
type are most abundant in the northern part of the South, particularly
in Virginia. They are rare in the plantation States.
This is mayhap due to the fact that in the selection of people to
be sold to the traders such delicate folk were retained where they
belonged&mdash;as house servants. These rare negroes, which for lack
of a better name will be termed Arabs, are few in number. They
can not be reckoned at more than one per cent of the whole.</p>

<p>Besides the comparatively recognizable types above reckoned,
there is another which puzzles the observer. They are of varied
shapes, generally, however, rather smaller than the average. Their
peculiarity consists in the reddish-brown hue of their skins, which
at first suggests that they are mulattoes. Their faces and hands
are often distinctly blotched with darker patches, in the manner
of freckles. At times I have been inclined to regard their features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
as indicating a tendency to albinism, or that change of pigment
such as now and then gives silver foxes or white blackbirds.
All things considered, it seems more likely that we have in these
red negroes the remnant of a people once distinctly separated
from the other black Africans. In favor of this view is the fact
that the members of the group are very evenly distributed,
as they would be if they were a distinct race, and not as we
should expect to find them if they were the result of albinism
or of a mixture of white blood. The number of this variety
of folk is small; it probably does not exceed one per cent of the
population.</p>

<p>When the observer has made the divisions above noted he has
set apart a little more than one half of the blacks he has tried to
classify. Among the remainder he will have remarked other but
indistinct types in a way that appears to indicate that several other
fairly characterized groups might by close scrutiny be established.
The greater part of this remainder, however, evidently consists
of mixed people, who have come from a mingling of the original
diverse stocks.</p>

<p>Imperfectly founded and inadequate as are the results of my
rough inspection of the Southern negroes, they fairly serve to show
some facts of importance to those who would helpfully foresee the
future of the black people in this country. We may first remark
that, notwithstanding the many distinct racial qualities and diversity
which, to my eye, far exceed what we may observe among the
whites of the United States, they are, with the exception of the
mulattoes, in excellent physical condition. They are of curiously
even, serviceable size, dwarfs and giants being very rare&mdash;much
rarer than among the whites. The percentage of deformed persons
is, so far as the eye can determine it, very low. I am fairly
well acquainted with the peasant class in most of the European
states, and I know of no region where the average condition of the
folk appears to be so good as it is among the Southern blacks. In
fact, this state is doubtless due to the rigid selection which was
had when the Africans were chosen for export; in part to the care
of their bodies during the time when they were slaves. The result
is a distinctly chosen people, well fitted to carry the burdens of
this world.</p>

<p>The variety of physical quality which appears to exist among
the negroes is important, for the reason that it appears to be associated
with mental differences even as great, thus affording a basis
for the differentiation of the people as regards occupations and
consequent station in life. It is even more difficult to get at the
mental peculiarities of the several groups of black folk than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to ascertain those of their bodies, so what I shall now set forth
is stated with much doubt. It represents my own opinion, qualified
by that of others whose judgments I have sought. In the
Guinea type we have a folk of essentially limited intelligence.
The children are rather nimble-witted, but when the body begins
to be mature it dominates the mind. It seems likely that thus the
largest element of the race is to find its place in the field or in the
lower stages of craft work. The Zulu type appears to me fit for
anything that the ordinary men of our own race can do. They
remain through life alert and with a capacity for a vigorous reaction
with their associates. From them may come the leaders of
their kindred of less masterful quality. From the Arab type we
may expect more highly educable people than is afforded by the
other distinct groups. They have more delicate qualities. They
lack the wholesome exuberance of the ordinary negro, which is
commonly termed “bumptiousness.” Their nature is often what
we may term clerical. They are inclined to be somber, but are
not morose in the manner of a “musty” elephant, as is frequently
the case with the Guinea and Zulu types. Of the red or freckled
negroes I have no sufficient grounds for an opinion, yet they as a
whole impress me less favorably than any other of the distinct
groups. As for the unclassified remainder of the blacks, it can
only be said that they seem to be as varied in their mental as they
are in their physical character.</p>

<p>The mulattoes of this country appear to be of less importance
to the future of the people with which they are classed than they
are in other parts of the world, where the white element of the
mixture is from other than the Teutonic stock. They are in general
of feeble vitality, rarely surviving beyond middle age. My
father, an able physician, who had been for nearly all of a long
life in contact with negroes, was of the opinion that he had never
seen a half-breed who was more than sixty years old. There is
certainly a notable lack of aged people of a hue that would indicate
that they were anywhere near an equal mixture of the white
and black races. Those in which the blood of white stock predominates
appear to be more enduring than the half-breeds.</p>

<p>While the intellectual qualities of the mixed white and black
are often very good and the attractiveness of the person and manner
sometimes remarkable, they have in general a rather bad reputation
as regards trustworthiness. Such a view of mestizos is common
in all countries where they occur. Humboldt is quoted
(though I have not found the matter in his works) as saying that
all mixed races have rather the evil than the good of the races
from which they sprang. In the case of the mulattoes, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
there seems to be no warrant for this judgment, and all we know
of offspring of diverse species in the animal and plant world fails
to give it any support. It is most likely that this opinion as to
the mixed white and black people is but one of the varieties of
race prejudice where the sufferer is often despised by those who
are below him as well as those who are above. The lot of all
human half-breeds is unhappy in that they are limited to a narrow
field of association. They are not perfectly free to make friends
with either of the peoples to whom they are kin. Considering the
peculiar situation of the mulattoes, the difficulty of which no one
who has not sought information on the matter can well conceive,
it seems to me that their way of life is creditable to them. On
their own and other accounts, however, we may welcome the fact
that their mixed stock is likely to disappear, being merged in those
whence it sprang.</p>

<p>In considering the future of our American negroes it is important
that we should make a judgment as to their moral tendencies.
This is not easy to do, for the statistics of crime are not in
such form as to make it clear in what regards they depart from
the averages of the white population. There can, however, be no
doubt that at first they were addicted to small thieving, and that
this habit continued until after the civil war. Southern people,
well placed for forming an opinion, believe that this evil is passing
away, from the development of the property sense. As for
drunkenness, the negro appears to be on the whole less tempted
to it than are the whites. One rarely finds the sot type among
them. Those of the lower class are liable to curious contagious
excitements, which often make them behave as if they were intoxicated
when they are not so. A scene I witnessed on a train out
of New Orleans, a few years ago, illustrates this and other significant
features of the negro character. It was a Sunday morning,
and the car assigned to blacks was full of sturdy fellows, mostly
of the Guinea type. Explaining to the conductor that I wished
to see the people, he allowed me to take a seat in the rear of the
carriage. At first my neighbors looked askance at me, but with
a word they became friendly. While the train was at rest the
throng was still, but as soon as it was in motion singing and shouting
began. There was a lull at every station, but with each renewal
of the motion the excitement rose higher, until it became
very great. A white newsboy, a fellow of some eighteen or twenty
years, was engaged in selling papers and candy. As he passed
along the aisle one of the negroes sprang at him, knife in hand.
In a flash the boy had the muzzle of his pistol almost against the
assailant’s head. At this every negro in the car was afoot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
shouting. Fearing the boy might be struck from behind, I moved
near to him, intending to caution him not to fire too soon, for I
was sure that his opponent would quickly break down. The youngster
needed no advice of mine. In a steady, low voice he called,
“Put up your knife&mdash;<i>one</i>!” With that the throng became suddenly
still. “Put up your knife&mdash;<i>two</i>!” whereupon the ugly fellow
slowly hid his knife and sank into a seat with bowed head,
while the newsboy went on crying his wares, as if nothing unusual
had happened.</p>

<p>Thinking that the negro might have had some grudge in mind,
I asked the newsboy for the facts. He assured me that he had
never seen the fellow before, and had no reason to expect the
attack. He agreed with me that none of the people were drunk,
and accounted for their conduct much as I was disposed to do&mdash;that
“coons would get wild when there was a racket going on.”
It was interesting to note that the brakemen, who, with their pistols
ready, came from either end of the car, took the affair as quietly
as did the newsboy, making no kind of comment on it. I stayed
on for an hour or so in the car. While I was there the negroes
were perfectly quiet, it being evident that although the offender
was not arrested and no blow had been struck, not even a brutal
word used, a profound impression had been made on those half-savage
people, as in another way on me. We both felt what means
the strong hand of a masterful race&mdash;the stronger when it withholds
from smiting. I had seen a good example of one of the
ways by which the wild men of Africa have been shaped to the
habits of their masters. Such a scene as I have sketched is happily
possible in only a limited part of the South&mdash;that in which
there is a great body of negroes who have not yet been to any
extent influenced by civilizing contact with the whites.</p>

<p>There is a common assertion that the male negroes are sexually
dangerous animals. The lynchings for assaults on white women
appear at first sight to give some color to this view. It is, however,
evidently a difficult matter on which to form an opinion.
It may be fairly said that these instances of violence occur in by
far the larger proportion in the States where the blacks are least
domesticated, where they have been in the smallest measure removed
from their primitive savagery. If we could eliminate this
uncivilized material, mostly that which took shape, or rather kept
its primitive shape, on the great plantation, the iniquity would be
as rare everywhere as it is in Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, North
Carolina, and Tennessee. When we recall the fact that there are
now some five million negro men in the South, and that probably
not one in ten thousand is guilty of the crime, we see how imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
is the basis of this judgment. We have also to remember that
this offense when committed by a negro is through the action of
the mob widely published, while if the offender be a white man it
is unlikely to be so well known. I therefore hold to the belief that
violence to women is not proved to be a crime peculiarly common
among the blacks. I am inclined to believe that, on the whole,
there is less danger to be apprehended from them in this regard
than from an equal body of whites of the like social grade. This
matter is one of exceeding importance, for on it may depend the
future of the South. It is fit that in considering it men should keep
their heads clear.</p>

<p>In reviewing the condition of the Eu-Africans a third of a century
after the war that gave them their new estate, we have, I
think, reason to be satisfied with the results of the change. The
change has brought us no distinct economic evils, as shown by the
statistics of the industries. The labor of the blacks is quite as productive
as it was while they were slaves. Their moral situation is
not evidently worse than it was before they attained the measure
of liberty which they now possess. The first step, that which naturally
caused the most fear, has been taken, the people are free and
have not turned their liberty to license. In looking forward, however,
we see that only a part of the task has been done. The negroes
have failed to acquire, save in very small proportion, the
capacity for a true political life. It has been found necessary to
deprive them of the control they once exercised, to the peril of the
States and their own great harm. The question is as to the ways
in which they are to be lifted into the safe plane of American citizenship.
They must be so lifted, or we shall in time see established
in the South a system of serfdom under the control of an
oligarchy&mdash;a state of affairs in some regards worse than that of
slavery, for it will lack the element of personal interest which did
much to help the black in the first stages of his life with us.</p>

<p>Faro II is a dog of fine breed and great intelligence, belonging to one
of the artists of <i>La Nature</i>, and has been engaged as an actor in the play
of Robinson Crusoe, at one of the theaters in Paris. On the stage his
name is Toby, and he knows it, and knows just what he has to do. He has
entered into relations with his fellow-actors, and obeys his cue instantly.
He does the stage business with strict accuracy, picks up the bird that is
shot and takes it to Robinson, looks up his yams and the vegetable soup and
his pipe. He is grieved when Robinson is sad, exults when he is rejoicing,
and looks after his fellow-actors&mdash;the goat, the monkey, and the parrot&mdash;who
are not so bright as he. Off the stage he knows nothing of Toby
or of Robinson Crusoe, answers to no name but Faro, and recognizes no
master but the artist, M. Weisser.</p>

<h2 title="The Birds of the Adirondacks" id="birds">THE BIRDS OF THE ADIRONDACKS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Senator GEORGE CHAHOON</span>.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">I shall</span> make no appeal for the protection of our birds, for that
is not necessary to those who know them; but I wish we could
all know them better, and when we knew we would surely love
and give them our protection. We would then realize their great
use as insect and weed destroyers; they would fascinate us with
their cunning habits, and charm us with their beauty and grace.</p>

<p>Most of our birds are migrators, passing their breeding season
in summer with us and then leaving for warmer climes. In addition
to the climatic reasons for this migration, the question of food
supply is doubtless an important factor, for while they might stand
the severity of our winters the insectivorous birds could not get
any food when our ground was covered with snow and ice, and, in
proof of this, as a rule the omnivorous migratory birds are the
first to come in the spring and the last to leave in the fall.</p>

<p>In 1877 I began making notes of the arrival of the robin, bluebird,
and swallow; these notes have been made every spring, mostly
by myself, but during my absence by some member of my family,
and were all taken at Au Sable Forks. The earliest date for the
robin is March 10th; for the bluebird, March 7th; and for the
swallow, April 4th. The latest date for the robin is April 7th;
for the bluebird, April 7th; and for the swallow, April 25th.
The average date is for the robin, March 28th; bluebird, March
26th; and the swallow, April 15th.</p>

<p>In every year the first robins that came were males, and this was
true with the bluebird excepting two years when I saw both male
and female birds on the same day. The sex of the swallow is not
as easily determined, and I am not sure about them, but my general
observation has been that the males come first, and are followed
in a few days by the females, and that the courtship and mating
are all arranged after their arrival. My observations have been
quite careful, and I think they are full enough to go far toward
establishing this fact. Of course, there will be exceptions and our
observations are necessarily imperfect, for it is not probable that
we happen to see the very first bird that comes.</p>

<p>No bird is more generally known or more universally liked than
our common robin. Every year he sings for us our praises to the
coming spring from the tallest limb of the elm, and he hops across
our lawn with a cuteness that forces a hearty welcome, and, differing
from most birds, he seems to be more numerous each year. In
a few days his mate joins him, and a search for a site for their first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
nest begins. The robin lays four eggs, and frequently raises three
broods of young in a season, never, so far as I know, using the
same site or the same nest twice in one season, or more certainly
never using the same nest or site for two consecutive broods. Year
after year the same corner in the porch or the same crotch in
the apple tree will be used as a nesting place by the robin, and we
have all wondered if the same robins came back every year, or if
the young birds returned and used the nest in which they were
hatched. The birds look and act wonderfully familiar when the
old site is occupied, and many people are sure they remember the
birds from the year preceding. I have never seen a statement
from any ornithologist throwing light on this interesting question,
and I twice made an attempt, without success, to obtain the information
for myself.</p>

<p>All thrushes except the robin are mottled on the breast, and
the breast of the young robin is mottled for the first season, so the
young can be readily told from the old birds. The robin is a
great lover of angleworms. The young follow the mother while
she gathers worms to feed them, and about the time for weaning
the young birds I have frequently seen the mother bird pick up
straws and sticks and offer them to her young instead of food.
This may be done to discourage them from following her any
longer, but I think it is more probably caused by a return of the
nest-building instinct to the mother.</p>

<p>Some years ago I put a small bird box on a post in our yard,
which was soon occupied by a pair of summer wrens, and all went
nicely with them until a pair of English sparrows concluded to
drive the wrens away and take the house for themselves, and for
three or four days the wrens and sparrows were constantly fighting,
but the wrens finally won and held possession of the house, although
at a great sacrifice, for after the fight was over I raised the lid
of the box and found the young birds dead, the fight evidently
taking so much of the time and attention of the old birds that they
allowed their young to starve. I removed the dead birds, and in
a short time the wrens rebuilt the nest, and this time they closed
the hole for entrance until it was scarcely large enough to admit
my thumb.</p>

<p>The box was occupied by wrens for several years, but the entrance
was never closed afterward, and I kept the sparrows from
any further interference. In this connection I would say that,
at least so far as the English sparrow is concerned, the male selects
the site for the nest. When I shot the female the male soon returned
with another mate, but when I shot the male the female
did not return. The wren builds a very coarse nest, and fills the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
box nearly half full of sticks three or four inches long. As these
sticks are carried in the birds’ bills by the middle, they would
naturally strike the hole crosswise and could not enter, so when the
birds get near the box they turn sideways and poke the sticks in
end first, following in and arranging them afterward.</p>

<p>The merganser is a fish duck nearly as large as our common
domestic duck, and is known under the names of sheldrake and
sawbill duck. The male is considerably larger than the female;
he has a jet-black head, and the black extends down the neck for
about two inches, where the color changes to a pure white, the
line being as regular and distinct as the painting on the smokestack
of a steamship. The body is generally white, with black
markings on the wings and some black on the body; the breast is
a beautiful salmon color when the bird is killed, but if mounted
soon fades to a pure white. The male merganser in full plumage
is one of our most beautiful birds.</p>

<p>The female, besides being smaller, is of a grayish color, and the
plumage and general appearance are entirely unlike the male, so
that the sex can be easily determined even at a long distance.</p>

<p>This bird is common on the Champlain and waters of the Adirondacks.
Like all fish ducks, it has a long, sharp bill, which is
serrated with sawtooth-shaped notches strongly suggesting teeth,
a fact which has given this bird much interest to our evolutionary
scientists.</p>

<p>I have noticed a habit of this bird that I believe is entirely
unique, and one I am surprised that our authorities on birds have
not mentioned&mdash;that is, that the males are entirely migratory and
the females are not. After the lakes and still waters freeze the
mergansers go to the rivers which are open in some places on the
rapids all winter. For more than twenty years I have seen female
mergansers on the Au Sable River all winter, and I have frequently
seen them on the other Adirondack rivers; but I have never seen
a male merganser in the winter, and in the late fall the males and
females gather in separate flocks, and when the male mergansers
appear in the spring they are always in flocks by themselves.</p>

<p>I think the merganser lives entirely on fish, and it is surprising
to one who has made no observations on the subject to know
what an enormous number of young fish a flock of these ducks will
destroy in a season. I quote the following from my notebook:
“October 13, 1882, killed fish duck (female merganser) in Slush
Pond, and found in her throat and stomach one pickerel, four black
bass, and eleven sun perch. Bob (my brother) present. October
18, 1882, killed same kind of duck on Lake Champlain, and took
out of her sixty small perch. James R. Graves present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Our most valuable game bird is the ruffed grouse or partridge.
He stays with us all the time. He is a strong, swift flier, and taxes
the nerve and skill of the sportsman to a high degree, and to bring
down a partridge under full wing in the evergreens in November
sends a thrill of delight through one’s veins.</p>

<p>The partridge is a gallinaceous bird, and the young leave the
nest as soon as hatched, running around with the mother like
chickens. Upon the approach of danger the young hide themselves
under the leaves in an incredibly short time, and the mother flutters
off with an apparently broken wing, keeping just out of reach
to lure you away from the hiding place of her young. This ruse
is employed by many birds, but in none, so far as I know, to as
large an extent as the partridge. Naturally a very timid bird, the
partridge will put up quite a bluff for a fight in defense of her
young, and on two occasions I knew a partridge to show fight without
any young. Experience has satisfied me that a partridge knows
enough to try and get a tree between himself and the huntsman,
and to keep it there until he is out of range.</p>

<p>Partridges are less numerous around my home than they were
twenty years ago, and their habits have undergone a very decided
change. Then they usually took to a tree when flushed; now they
seldom light on a tree, and take much longer flights. When hunting
in Canada last fall I found that the partridges were very tame,
and simply ran away from me, or if pressed flew into trees near
by and waited for their heads to be taken off with rifle balls.</p>

<p>I notice considerable difference in the shade coloring of the
partridge, some being much darker than others, but all have the
same markings. The partridge is omnivorous, and, like man and
the pig, he eats almost everything. In the winter he lives upon
the buds of trees, and many a bird has lost his life while filling his
crop from this source, as he is then an easy mark for the hunter,
and I have seen the marks of his bill on the carcasses of animals.
He is fond of blackberries, and sportsmen often visit blackberry
patches when looking for him in the early fall, but I have been
surprised to find that when feeding in a blackberry patch he apparently
shows no preference for the ripe berries, filling his crop with
all kinds. A fact about the partridge which I find is not generally
known is, while in summer its toes are plain, like the toes of a
chicken, in the winter they are bordered with a stiff hairy fringe
that gives it support on the snow, having the same effect as the
meshes of our snowshoes. This is a fact of considerable interest,
for it seems to have a bearing upon the theory that there is a
tendency in animals to develop conditions favorable to their environment.
Under this theory one might hope to find a development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of a substitute for a snowshoe on a non-migratory bird whose
habits keep it largely upon the ground, while no such development
would be expected on a bird that leaves us in the winter for warmer
climes.</p>

<p>In this connection I would say that while few of our native birds
change the color of their plumage as an adaptation to the seasons,
our pretty thistle bird, or American goldfinch, undergoes a radical
change. In summer he has a bright yellow body with black markings
and a black head, while in winter his plumage is all pale brown
or sparrow-color, and we often fail to recognize in our somber winter
resident the brilliant goldfinch of our summer. These little
birds are gregarious in the winter, and as they fly in small flocks
into the trees by the roadside they are frequently mistaken for
sparrows, and in fact are usually called tree sparrows.</p>

<p>There are few things connected with the study of natural history
more interesting than the tendency in animals to develop conditions
suitable to their environment, and it is surprising to see for
how long a time an acquired habit will sometimes survive after its
usefulness has ceased.</p>

<p>The common chimney swallows always build their nests in chimneys
that are unused during their breeding season. They make a
semicircular nest of sticks, which they glue to the inside wall of
the chimney with a secretion from their mouths. It is interesting
to see the swallows gather the sticks for their nests, for they do
not alight on the ground, but, while flying, break off dead twigs
from trees without stopping in their flight.</p>

<p>This habit of building in chimneys must have been acquired in
a comparatively short time, for there were no chimneys in this
country before the arrival of the white man, and for a long time
afterward the settler had but one chimney in his house, which must
have been used, at least for cooking purposes, in the summer. So
perfect is this habit that the swallow looks and acts as though he
were made for the chimney; his color is a sooty black, so that he
does not tarnish his coat by rubbing against the chimney walls;
the feathers of his tail end in hard spikes, that he can use them to
prop himself against the wall. I have been interested on a summer
evening watching these swallows in hundreds circling around
a church chimney in Plattsburg, until finally the birds in the
center began to enter the chimney, the circle growing smaller and
smaller as they apparently poured down in the vortex of a whirlpool
of swallows. Many birds have acquired a habit of associating
with man, and we rarely find them, except during the season
of their flight, far away from houses.</p>

<p>The barn swallows always place their nests under the eaves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
cornices of some building, usually a barn. These nests are built
of mud gathered by the birds from wet places on the ground, and
carried in their mouths to the sites chosen by them. Many of our
farmers have an unkind feeling for the barn swallows, as they think
the mud-daubed nests on the new red paint are not an artistic addition;
but if our cattle could give an intelligent opinion they would
welcome the birds, for all swallows are entirely insectivorous, and
they must eat many flies and mosquitoes that otherwise would be
left to torment our animals.</p>

<p>Birds that build in inaccessible places seem to rely upon that
for security, and apparently make little effort to conceal their
nests, while those building on or near the ground are generally
careful to hide them, and they display considerable cunning in
preventing discovery. Robins, for instance, after the young are
hatched, never drop the eggshells over the side of the nests to the
ground, where they would attract attention and cause one to look
directly overhead and thus find the nest, but take the broken shells
in their bills and carry them off, dropping them while flying. Frequently
birds are very shy and easily frightened away from their
nests, but after they are well established they sometimes show a
good deal of tenacity in staying by them until the young are ready
to leave.</p>

<p>Some years ago we opened an old ore mine, where a pair of
phœbe birds had placed their nest on a shelf a few feet overhead,
a projecting rock protecting it from the flying stones of the blasts
that were fired several times a day, and the men were working so
near that they could almost touch it with their hands. These
birds did not desert their nests until the young were old enough to
leave. The site was not used the following year, as is usually the
case with the phœbe bird.</p>

<p>No bird has insinuated himself into our affections more deeply
than the bluebird. He charms us as he flits through the air like
a painted arrow, reflecting the sunlight from the metallic luster
of his wings, while he pours out his inspired song “in notes as sweet
as angels’ greetings when they meet.” He comes to us before the
unfolding of the first bud of spring, sings to us until our hills and
mountains are covered with the richness of their summer verdure,
and stays with us until this verdure is changed to all the beauty of
its autumnal glory. I am very sorry, but I believe our bluebirds
are gradually though steadily decreasing in numbers. Some years
ago two pairs nested in our yard, one pair in a hole in an old apple
tree and one pair in a box, but for several years these nesting places
have been unoccupied, and I know of a number of other former
nesting places that have been vacant for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Twenty years ago the wild pigeons were quite plentiful in the
fall of the year in this part of our State, but each fall they came
in decreasing numbers, and for the last four or five years I have
not seen a single bird.</p>

<p>There is no sweeter songster than the shy hermit thrush, and
I am much pleased in believing that his numbers are increasing.
In former years they were not often heard; now, as our spring
afternoons decline into twilight, his charming notes come to us
from almost every suitable point.</p>

<p>For the first eight or ten years of my residence in Au Sable
Forks I did not see a turtle dove, and now I see them nearly every
summer.</p>

<p>Our American eagle is occasionally seen in the Adirondacks, and
some years ago a large female golden eagle was caught in a steel
trap near my home and came into my possession, where she occupied
a slatted hencoop, and whenever curiosity led a hen to poke
her bill through the slats her head was taken off very quickly. I
was afraid that if I kept the eagle I would turn vivisectionist or
become too cruel for a hunter, so I presented her to the Zoölogical
Gardens in Central Park.</p>

<p>In birds of prey the female is the larger and finer bird, while
the reverse is true with other birds; but there is a striking exception
in the noble woodcock. No bird is held in higher appreciation
by the sportsman, and a female woodcock in full plumage is
as rich in coloring and as beautiful in marking as any bird I know.
He lies well for the dog, is rare sport for the gunner, and has no
equal for the palate. He nests in our alder thickets or on wet
marshy ground, and around my home it is the work of a man to
get him. He is nocturnal in his habits, feeding at night and pushing
his long, slender bill into the soft ground, leaving holes that
to the casual eye look like worm holes, but which are easily recognized
by one familiar with his habits.</p>

<p>Cow blackbirds are common to this locality during the summers,
and they are found in our pastures with the cattle. I have never
found their eggs in the nests of other birds, but they are Mormonistic
in their habits, one often having as many as a dozen wives, and
I have known the crow blackbird to have more than one mate.</p>

<p>Some years ago an article went the rounds of the newspapers
telling of a man catching a flock of crows by soaking corn in alcohol
and leaving it for the crows to eat, and when they became drunk
he caught them. I tried bread crumbs soaked in whisky on English
sparrows, but they would not eat them, and I finally got a crow,
and though I kept him until he was very hungry I could not get him
to eat corn soaked in whisky, and he found no difficulty in picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
up every unsoaked kernel and leaving the others. You may draw
your own moral, but I am satisfied that the crow will not eat food
saturated with alcohol. He is either too uncivilized or too intelligent.</p>

<p>Orioles and other birds sometimes give us much annoyance by
eating the green peas from our gardens, and, except in the case of
English sparrows, we do not like to shoot them. I once killed a
hawk and roughly stuffed it with straw, putting it on a pole near
my pea vine, where the birds collected in numbers to scold and
peck at it, but they were afraid to touch the peas, and finally left
mine for those of my neighbors across the street.</p>

<p>The Acadian owl is a pretty, cunning-looking little bird, not
much larger than a robin. He is the smallest of our owls and
quite tame, and is not often seen around my home. Some two years
ago, while hunting with my brother we saw one of these little birds
on the limb of a tree not far from the ground, and we concluded to
try and snare him. We cut a long pole and made a slip noose with
a shoe string, and while my brother kept the owl’s attention by
standing in front of him I slipped the noose over his head from
behind. When we had the owl we wanted to tie him, and since we
could not spare the shoe string for that purpose, my brother decided
to tie him with his watch chain. He snapped the catch
around one leg, and while trying to fasten the other leg the owl
made a flutter and got loose, and the last we saw of him he was
sailing over the tops of the trees with the watch chain hanging
to his leg.</p>

<p>I have always taken an interest in birds because I have loved
them, but it does not follow that I know much about them. Some
one said that the more we know men the less we love them, but
that man was an old cynic and doubtless told an untruth. Certain
it is that the more we know our native birds the more we love
them, and it is one of the encouraging signs of the day that it has
become fashionable for young people to take an increasing interest
in the birds and wild flowers of their own country, and a young
person would hardly be considered accomplished to-day who is entirely
ignorant of at least the common names of the flowers that
bloom in our fields and woods and the birds that pour out their
ecstatic music from our trees and hedges.</p>

<h2 title="The Structure of Blind Fishes" id="structure">THE STRUCTURE OF BLIND FISHES.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By CARL H. EIGENMANN</span>,<br />

<span class="small">PROFESSOR OF ZOÖLOGY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> <span class="smcap">Color of the Amblyopsidæ.</span>&mdash;The three species of Chologaster
are colored, with varying intensity, from C. cornutus,
which is darkest, to C. Agassizii, in which the color is faintest. The
color cells are in all cases arranged in a definite pattern. These
are determined by the underlying muscles. The pattern consists
of three longitudinal bands on the sides, following the line where
the muscle segments are angularly bent, and cross-stripes along
the line separating successive segments.</p>

<p>The general color of Typhlichthys is cream and pink. It is
abundantly pigmented. In younger specimens the pigment is
arranged in more definite areas about the head. In the old it
is more uniformly distributed, being, however, specially abundant
about the brain. The pigment pattern of the body is precisely
as in Chologaster, except that the individual pigment
cells are minute and their aggregate not evident except under
the lens.</p>

<p>The retention of the color pattern of Chologaster in Typhlichthys
is not less interesting than the retention of similar habits.
It is perhaps due to different causes. The color pattern in Chologaster
is determined by the underlying muscular structure, and
the retention of a similar pattern in Typhlichthys is due to the same
underlying structure, rather than to the direct hereditary transmission
of the color pattern.</p>

<p>Amblyopsis is flesh-colored, ranging to purple in the gill region,
where the blood of the gills shows through the overlying structures,
and over the liver, which can be seen through the translucent
sides and ventral wall. About the head and bases of the fins
the color is yellowish, resembling diluted blood. The surface of
the body is slightly iridescent, and the surface of the head has a
velvety, peach-bloom appearance.</p>

<p>The general pink color of Amblyopsis is due to the blood.
It is not due to any abnormal development of blood-vessels in the
dermis. In the fins, where the blood-vessels are near the surface,
the general effect is a yellowish color. The surface vessels of the
dermis also appear yellowish. It is only on account of the translucent
condition of all the tissues, permitting the deeper vessels
to show through a certain thickness, that the pink effect is produced.
Amblyopsis has always been spoken of as white. The
term “white aquatic ghosts” of Cope is very apt, for they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
appear white in the caves, and their gliding motion has an uncanny
effect. All alcoholic specimens are white.</p>

<p>The pigment cells can not be made to show themselves, even
by a prolonged stay in the light. The old, if kept in the light, will
not become darker, and a young one reared in the light until ten
months old not only showed no increase in the pigmentation but
lost the pigment it had at birth, taking on the exact pigmentless
coloration of the adult. Pigment cells are late in appearing in
Amblyopsis. When the young are two months old pigment is
abundant. This pigmented condition is evidently a hereditarily
transmitted condition. It disappears with age. Primarily this disappearance
was probably individual. But, as in the flounder, the
depigmentation has also become hereditarily transmitted, for even
those individuals reared in the light lose the color. Numerous
facts and experiments show that while pigment may be, and is,
developed in total darkness, the amount of color in an individual
animal depends, other things equal, directly on the amount of light
to which it is habitually exposed.</p>

<div id="ip_49" class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Chologaster Agassizii</i> from Cedar Sinks Cave, Kentucky.</div></div>

<p>The lower and upper surfaces of the flounder, the one protected
and the other exposed to the light, give the most striking example,
and the argument is clinched here by the fact, noted by Cunningham,
that a flounder whose lower side is for long periods exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to the light takes on color. Loeb has shown that in the yolk sacs
of Fundulus embryos more pigment cells are developed if the embryos
are kept in the light than when they are kept in the dark.
However, in the body, and especially in the eye, the pigmentation
was not affected by the absence of light.</p>

<p>The general absence of color in cave animals is conceded.
Packard states, “As regards change of color, we do not recall an
exception to the general rule that all cave animals are either colorless
or nearly white, or, as in the case of Arachnida and insects,
much paler than their out-of-door relatives.” Chilton has made
the same observation on the underground animals of New Zealand.
Similar observations have been recorded by Lönnberg, Carpenter,
Schmeil, and Viré. Hamann enumerates a number of species living
both in caves and above ground. In such cases the underground
individuals are paler than the others. This confirms similar observations
by Packard.</p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Chologaster papilliferus</i> from Illinois.</div></div>

<p>Poulton has mentioned that Proteus becomes darker when exposed
to the light. This has been verified by others. Typhlotriton
larvæ living at the entrance of a cave are dark, while the
adult living farther in the cave are much lighter, but with many
chromatophores containing a small amount of color. Epigæan
fishes found in caves are always lighter in color than their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrères</i>
outside.</p>

<div id="ip_50b" class="figcenter" style="width: 293px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Typhlichthys subterraneus.</i></div></div>

<p>We have thus numerous examples of colored epigæan animals
bleaching in caves, and also bleached cave animals turning dark
when exposed to the light. We have also animals in which the
side habitually turned to the dark is colorless, while the side habitually
turned to the light is colored. Finally, we have cave animals
that are permanently bleached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Natural selection can not have affected the coloration of the
cave forms, for it can be absolutely of no consequence whether a
cave species is white or black. It could affect the coloration only
indirectly in one of two ways: First, as a matter of economy, but
since the <i>individual</i> is in part bleached by the direct effect of the
darkness there is no reason why natural selection should come into
play at all in reducing the pigment as a matter of economy; second,
Romanes has supposed that the color decreases through the selection
of correlated structures&mdash;a supposition he found scarcely conceivable
when the variety of animals showing the bleached condition
is considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Panmixia can not account for the reduction of the color, since
it returns in some species when they are exposed to the light, and
disappears to a certain extent in others when kept in the dark.
Panmixia, Romanes thinks, may have <i>helped</i> to discharge the color.
In many instances the coloration is a protective adaptation, and
therefore maintained by selection. Panmixia might in such instances
lower the general average to what has been termed the
“birth mean.” Proteus is perhaps such an instance. But in this
species the bleached condition has not yet been hereditarily established,
and since each individual is independently affected “the
main cause of change must have been of that direct order which
we understand by the term climatic.”</p>

<p>Since, however, the bleached condition, which in the first instance
is an individual reaction to the absence of light, has become
hereditarily established in Amblyopsis so that the bleaching goes
on even when the young are reared in the light, it is evident that
in Amblyopsis we have the direct effect of the environment on
the individual hereditarily established.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eyes of the Amblyopsidæ.</span>&mdash;The structure of the eyes has
formed the basis of a separate, fully illustrated <span class="locked">paper.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span> The prominent
features in the eyes of the various species must, however, be
known before the question of the origin of these forms and the
causes of degeneration can be seriously considered. The eyes of
the species of Chologaster are normally formed, possessing a lens,
pupil, vitreous body, retina, and optic nerve, and all the eye muscles
normal to the fishes. The eyes are functional. The retina
is, however, very much simplified. The eye of papilliferus is, in
this respect, more perfect than the eye of cornutus. In papilliferus
the outer nuclear layer consists of two series of nuclei, the inner
layer of about five series of nuclei, and the ganglionic layer of a
complete single layer of nuclei except where the optic fibers pass
between them, for an optic-fiber layer is not present. In Chologaster
cornutus the outer nuclear layer has been reduced to one
or two series, and the ganglionic layer to cells widely separated
from each other or in rows and little groups, but no longer forming
a complete layer. In Amblyopsis and Typhlichthys the largest
eyes are not more than one twentieth the diameter of those of
Chologaster, or one thousandth of their bulk; the lens is nearly,
if not quite, obliterated; the same is true of the vitreous body and
the optic nerve in the adult. Beyond this the eyes differ much.
In Amblyopsis scleral cartilages are present and prominent, the
pigmented layer is prominent, the outer and inner nuclear layers
form one layer only, two or three cells deep. In T. subterraneus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the pigmented layer is insignificant, and no pigment is ever found
in it, while the outer and inner nuclear layers are still separate. In
both these species the ganglionic layer forms a central core of cells.
In Amblyopsis several or all the eye muscles are present; in Typhlichthys
nothing is left of them.</p>

<p>Scleral cartilages are not present in Chologaster or Typhlichthys;
in Troglichthys they are very prominent, sometimes <i>several
times as long as the eye</i>. While there is no pigment left in
Typhlichthys, there is in Troglichthys. The eye in the former is
about 0.168 millimetre in diameter, while the entire eye of the
latter is but about 0.050 millimetre, or less than one third the diameter,
and less than one ninth the bulk.</p>

<p>The entire eye of Troglichthys is smaller than many single cells,
and I shall be pardoned for not going into the details of its structure
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tactile Organs.</span>&mdash;The tactile organs are among the most
important in the consideration of the blind forms. Their minute
structure will form the basis of a separate paper. The prominent
tactile organs about the head of Amblyopsis have been mentioned
by nearly every writer, and they have been figured by <span class="locked">Putnam-Wyman<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span>
and <span class="locked">Leidig,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> but the figures of the distribution of the
ridges are worthless. The description of Professor <span class="locked">Forbes<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></span> of
Chologaster papilliferus is the only systematic enumeration of the
ridges that has appeared. The accompanying figures, drawn by
me with the <i>camera lucida</i>, and verified and copied by Mr. U.&nbsp;O.
Cox, give the exact extent and position of the ridges in Amblyopsis
and Chologaster papilliferus. It will be seen that in the number
and distribution of the tactile area the two forms agree very
closely, the eyed form having the same number and distribution
of ridges or rows that the blind forms have. In Chologaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
papilliferus most of the ridges are much less prominent than in
the blind species, being sunk into the skin. About the nose and
chin, however, the ridges are as prominent as in the other species.
In the small Chologaster cornutus there are no distinct ridges
at all, the tactile organs being arranged
as in other species of fishes. In specimens
of the same size the papillæ are
not more prominent in papilliferus
than in cornutus. It is only in the
oldest of papilliferus that the papillæ
become prominent. The number of
individual papillæ in each tactile ridge
differs considerably with age (size), so
that an exact comparison between the
large Amblyopsis and the much smaller
species of Chologaster and Typhlichthys
can not be made. From a number of counts made by Professor
Cox I take the liberty of giving the following: Ridge No.
6 contains, in Chologaster papilliferus, six organs; in Typhlichthys,
eleven; in two specimens of Amblyopsis, respectively eighty-three
and one hundred and six inches long, twelve and twenty.</p>

<p>Aside from the tactile organs in ridges, there are many solitary
ones not evident from the surface in Amblyopsis. When
the epidermis is removed by maceration, the dermal papillæ on
which these rest give the whole head a velvety appearance.</p>

<p>In the young, at least of Amblyopsis, each of the tactile organ
of the ridges is provided with a club-shaped filament abruptly
pointed near the end. They wave about with the slightest motion
in water, and are so numerous as to give the whole head a woolly
appearance.</p>

<p>To recapitulate the facts ascertained concerning the eye and
tactile organs:</p>

<p>1. The eyes were degenerating and the tactile organs developing
beyond the normal before the permanent underground existence
began.</p>

<p>2. The eyes continued to degenerate and the tactile organs to
increase after permanent entrance to underground waters.</p>

<p>3. In the degeneration of the eye the retina leads; the vitreous
body and lens follow; the more passive pigmented layer and
sclera remain longest; the bony orbit is not affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bearing of the Facts gained on the Origin of the Cave
Fauna.</span>&mdash;The origin of the cave fauna and of the blind fauna
are two distinct questions. This was first recognized by H.
Garman. Before, the two questions were considered as one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and two explanations are prominent among those suggesting its
solution:</p>

<p>1. The explanation of Lankester seems either a pleasantry or
the most unwarranted speculation. He says: “Supposing a number
of some species of Arthropod or fish to be swept into a cavern
or to be carried from less to greater depths in the sea, those individuals
with perfect eyes would follow the glimmer of light, and
eventually escape to the outer air or the shallower depths, leaving
behind those with imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. A
natural selection would thus be effected. In every succeeding generation
this would be the case, and even those with weak but still
seeing eyes would in the course of time escape, until only a pure
race of eyeless or blind animals would be left in the cavern or
deep sea.”</p>

<div id="ip_55" class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
  <img src="images/illo_061.jpg" width="800" height="464" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Lateral view of <i>Amblyopsis</i>, showing the location of the tactile ridges.</div></div>

<p>This process does not, of course, account for the degeneration
of the eye beyond blindness. But, aside from this objection, the
humor of his “glimmer of light” impresses itself very forcibly
on one after spending a day in following the devious windings of a
living cave, not to mention his tendency in cave animals, which
are negatively heliotropic, to follow it. There are other objections.
Fishes are annually swept into the caves, but they are not
able to establish themselves in them. To do this they must have
peculiar habits, special methods of feeding and mating before a
successful colonization of caverns can become successful. Further,
if the origin of the cave fauna is due to accident, the accident
must have happened to four species out of six of the Amblyopsidæ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
while none of the numerous other species of fishes about
the caves met with the same accident.</p>

<p>2. The second explanation is that of Herbert <span class="locked">Spencer:<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></span> “The
existence of these blind cave animals can be accounted for only
by supposing their remote ancestors began making excursions into
the caves, and, finding it profitable, extended them, generation
after generation, farther in, undergoing the required adaptations
little by little.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Popular Science Monthly, vol. xliii, pp. 487, 488.</p></div>

<p>This second view has been modified by H. Garman in so far as
he supposes the adaptations to do without eyes and consequent
degeneration of eyes to occur anywhere where a species has no use
for eyes, enumerating burrowing animals and parasitic animals,
concluding that “the origin of the cave species (nonaquatic especially)
of Kentucky were probably already adjusted to a life in
the earth before the caves were formed.” In this modified sense,
Spencer’s view is directly applicable to the Amblyopsidæ. Hamann
goes so far as to suppose that darkness itself is not the primary
cause of degeneration, but unknown factors in the animal itself.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Lateral view of <i>Chologaster papilliferus</i>, showing the location of the tactile ridges.</div></div>

<p>The three things to be considered in this connection are (<i>a</i>)
the habit of the cave form, (<i>b</i>) the modifications to enable the form
to do without the use of light, and (<i>c</i>) the structure of the eye as
a result of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The prime requisite for a candidate to underground existence
is a negative reaction to light. We found that even the
epigæan Chologaster is negatively heliotropic.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> It must also be evident that a fish depending on its sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
to procure its food can never become a cave form. Sunfishes,
which are annually carried into caves, belong to this class of fishes.
They are always poor when found in the caves, and will never be
able to establish themselves in them. On the other hand, there
are no reasons why fishes detecting their prey either by smell or
touch should not be capable of colonizing caves. The catfishes and
Amblyopsidæ belong to the latter class. It is surprising that more
catfishes have not established themselves in caves. Among the
Amblyopsidæ even those with functional eyes depend on touch
and vibrations for their food. Chologaster has well-developed tactile
organs and poor eyes. It is found chiefly at the mouths of
underground streams, but also in the underground streams themselves.
The tactile organs are not different in kind from those of
other fishes, and their high development is not more marked than
their development in the barbels of the catfishes. The characters
which distinguish Chologaster as a fish capable of securing its
food in the dark are emphasized in Typhlichthys, and the tactile
organs are still more highly developed in Amblyopsis. The eyes
of the last two genera are so degenerate that it is needless in this
connection to speak of degrees of degeneration. On account of
the structure of their eyes and their loss of protective pigment they
are incapable of existence in open waters. With the partial and
total adaptation to an underground existence in the Amblyopsidæ
and their negative reaction to light, it is scarcely possible that for
this family the idea of accidental colonization can be entertained
for a moment. Their structure is not as much due to their habitat
as their habitat is to their structure and habit.</p>

<p>Typhlogobius lives in the holes of shrimps under rocks on the
coast of southern California. It is a living example of the origin
of blind forms in dark places remote from caves. Here again
the “accidental” idea is preposterous, since no fish could by accident
be carried into the devious windings of the burrows they
inhabit. Moreover, a number of related species of gobies occur
in the neighborhood. They live ordinarily in the open, but always
retreat into the burrows of crustaceans when disturbed. The origin
of the blind species by the gradual change from an occasional
burrow seeker to a permanent dweller in the dark and the consequent
degeneration of the eye is evident here at once. Among
insects the same process and the same results are noted. We have
everywhere the connection of diurnal species with dark-loving and
blind forms, a transition the result of habit entered into with
intent, but no evidence of such a connection as the result of accident.
Also numerous instances of daylight species being swept
into caves, but no instance of one establishing itself there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
This view accounts also for the wide distribution of the blind
fishes. The ancestry of the Amblyopsidæ we may assume to have
had a tendency to seek dark places wherever found, and incipient
blind forms would thus arise over their entire distribution. The
structural differences between Troglichthys and Typhlichthys argue
in favor of this, and certainly the fearless, conspicuous blind fish
as at present developed would have no chance of surviving in the
open water. Their wide distribution after their present characters
had been assumed, except through subterranean waters, would
be out of the question entirely. The same would not be true of
the incipient cave forms when they had reached the stage at present
found in Chologaster. It will be recalled that Chologaster,
and even the blind forms, have the habit of hiding underneath
boards and in the darker sides of an aquarium. These dark-seeking
creatures would, on the other hand, be especially well fitted
to become distributed in caves throughout their habitat. S. Garman’s
able argument for the single origin and dispersal of the
blind fishes through epigæan waters was based on the supposition
that the cis-Mississippi and trans-Mississippi forms were identical.
The differences between these species are such as to warrant not
only that they have been independently segregated, but that they
are descended from different genera. The external differences
between these species are trifling, but this was to be expected in
an environment where all the elements that make for external color
marking are lacking. The similarity between Typhlichthys and
Amblyopsis is so great that the former has been considered to be
the young of the latter.</p>

<p>Judging from the structure of the eye and the color of the
skin, Troglichthys has been longest established in caves. Amblyopsis
came next, and Typhlichthys is a later addition to the
blind cave fauna.</p>

<p>“Those,” said Dr. J.&nbsp;N. Langley, in his sectional address on Physiology
at the British Association, “who have occasion to enter into the
depths of what is oddly, if generously, called the literature of a scientific
subject, alone know the difficulty of emerging with an unsoured disposition.
The multitudinous facts presented by each corner of Nature form
in large part the scientific man’s burden to-day, and restrict him more
and more, willy nilly, to a narrower and narrower specialism. But that
is not the whole of his burden. Much that he is forced to read consists
of records of defective experiments, confused statement of results, wearisome
description of detail, and unnecessarily protracted discussion of
unnecessary hypotheses. The publication of such matter is a serious
injury to the man of science; it absorbs the scanty funds of his libraries,
and steals away his poor hours of leisure.”</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By F.&nbsp;W. CLARKE</span>,<br />

<span class="small">CHIEF CHEMIST, UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.<br />
<br />
[<i>Concluded.</i>]</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is evident, from what has been already said, that chemistry and
physics are near akin&mdash;indeed, they can hardly be separated.
Avogadro’s law and spectrum analysis are but two illustrations of
the relationship, but many other examples are equal to them in
importance. Take, for instance, the action of light upon chemical
substances; it may provoke union of elements, or effect the decomposition
of compounds; upon the latter phenomenon the art of photography
depends. That salts of silver are chemically changed by
light was the fundamental observation, and upon this fact most
photographic processes, though not all, are founded. Thus light,
working as a chemist in the laboratory of the photographic plate,
has become the useful servant of all arts, all sciences, and all industries&mdash;an
indispensable aid to invention and research. On this
theme a volume might be written; a bare reference to it must be
sufficient here.</p>

<p>Still another branch of chemistry, recently developed but essentially
an extension of the theory of valence, is also due to the study
of optical relations. That different crystalline bodies differ in
their behavior toward polarized light has long been known, and the
polariscope is recognized as an instrument of great value in chemical
research. To the analysis and valuation of sugars and sirups
it is most effectively applied, and commercial transactions of great
magnitude depend in part upon its testimony. Here is practical
utility, but the development of theory is what concerns us now.</p>

<p>The discovery of isomerism, of the fact that very different compounds
might contain the same elements united in the same proportions,
was easily interpreted by the theory of valence in a fairly
complete and satisfactory way. In the structural formulæ the different
atomic groupings were clearly shown, but with one essential
limitation&mdash;the arrangement was in a single plane. That is, the
linking of the atoms was considered, but not their relations to tridimensional
space. For the study of reactions, for the classification
of compounds, the structural symbols sufficed; but human
thought is not so easily satisfied, and more was soon required. One
class of isomers was unexplained, and an explanation was demanded.</p>

<p>A typical example of the difficulty was offered by tartaric acid,
which exists in two forms differing crystallographically and optically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
One form, dissolved in water, twisted a ray of polarized light
to the left, the other produced a rotation to the right, while the
crystals of the two acids, similar in all other respects, also showed
a right- and left-handedness in the arrangement of their planes.
The crystal of one variety resembled the other as would its reflection
in a mirror&mdash;the same, but reversed. These differences, discovered
by Pasteur as long ago as 1848, the theory of valence could
not explain; to interpret them, and other similar cases, the arrangement
of the atoms in space had to be considered.</p>

<p>In 1874 two chemists, Van t’Hoff and Lebel, working independently,
offered a solution of the problem, and stereochemistry,
the chemistry of molecular structure in three dimensions, was
founded. They proposed, in effect, to treat the carbon atom essentially
as a tetrahedron, the four angles corresponding to the four
units of valence or bonds of affinity. They then studied the linking
or union of such tetrahedra, and found that with their aid the
formulæ for tartaric acid could be developed in different ways,
showing right- and left-handed atomic groupings. Other similar
compounds were equally explicable. Thus the definite conception
of a tridimensional, geometric atom led to a new development of
structural formulæ, from which many discoveries have already
proceeded. The fruitfulness of the speculation vindicates its use,
but it is only the first step in a method of research which must in
time be applied to all of the chemical elements. Probably the
study of crystalline form will be connected with these chemico-structural
expressions, and from the union some greater generalizations
will be born. From the geometry of the crystal to the geometry
of the molecule there must be some legitimate transition.
With all their utility, our present conceptions of chemical structure
are incomplete; they represent only portions or special phases of
some great general law, but so far as they go, properly used, they
are valid.</p>

<p>But light is not the only physical force involved in chemical
changes; heat and electricity are far more important. Heat, in
particular, is essential to every chemical operation; it provokes
combination and effects decomposition; it appears in one reaction
and vanishes in another; apart from thermal phenomena the science
of chemistry could not exist. From the very beginnings
of chemistry this interdependence has been recognized, and its
study has led to notable discoveries and to great enlargements of
resource. In the theory of phlogiston the connection between heat
and chemical change was crudely stated, and when Lavoisier saw
that combustion was oxidation, thermochemistry began to exist.</p>

<p>In every chemical change a definite amount of heat is either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
liberated or absorbed&mdash;a distinct, measurable quantity. This fact
was established by Hess in 1840, and since then the thermal values
of many reactions have been determined, notably by Thomsen in
Denmark and Berthelot in France. The data are already numerous,
but as yet they have not been co-ordinated into any general
law. They are in great measure the raw material with which
some future scholar is to build. One fact, however, is already
clear&mdash;namely, that the heat of formation or of combustion of
any compound is conditioned by its structure. Two isomeric substances
may differ widely in their calorific constants, an observation
which has repeatedly been verified. Thus the conception of
structure, of atomic grouping, appears again a chief factor in a set
of unsolved problems.</p>

<p>In the relations of chemistry to heat perhaps the greatest advances
have been made in the extension of our resources, particularly
in regard to the development and control of temperatures. At
the beginning of the century the range of temperatures available
to the chemist was narrowly limited&mdash;from the freezing point of
mercury at one end to the heat of a blast furnace at the other.
His command of heat and cold are now vastly greater than then,
and the steps which have been taken are worth tracing.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the scale the greatest progress has been
made through the liquefaction of gases. When a liquid evaporates,
heat is absorbed, or, reversely stated, cold is produced, and
the more rapid the evaporation the greater is the cooling effect.
A command of more volatile liquids is therefore a command of
cold, and the liquefied gases represent the extreme limit of our
power in that direction.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of the century, by combining cold and pressure,
sulphurous acid and chlorine were reduced to the liquid
state. In 1823 Faraday succeeded in liquefying still other gases,
and in 1835 Thilorier went even further and reduced carbonic acid
to a snowlike solid. Liquid chlorine, sulphurous acid, and carbonic
acid, stored in strong cylinders of steel, are now commercial products,
manufactured and sold in large quantities like any other
merchandise. They can be transported to long distances and kept
indefinitely, to the great convenience of chemists and the furtherance
of research.</p>

<p>In 1845 Faraday published the results of further investigations,
when it appeared that all but six of the known gases had been reduced
to the liquid state. Through cold and pressure lower and
lower temperatures were gained, each step forward having given
a foothold from which a new advance was possible. In 1877 Pictet
and Cailletet simultaneously succeeded in liquefying four of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
supposedly permanent gases; nitrogen yielded to the attacks of
Wroblevsky and Olzewski in 1883, and hydrogen alone remained
unconquered. In 1898 Dewar overcame this last obstacle, and in
the year following he actually reduced hydrogen to an icelike solid
which melts at only eighteen degrees centigrade above the theoretical
absolute zero. Every gas has been liquefied, and probably
the lowest degree of cold attainable by man has been reached.
Within the century the work began and ended; the future can
only improve the working methods and utilize the new resources.
Liquid ammonia has long been used in the manufacture of artificial
ice and for direct refrigeration; liquid air, with its temperature
of two hundred centigrade degrees below zero, is now almost a commercial
product, obtainable in quantity, but with its possibilities of
usefulness as yet practically undeveloped. The infant Hercules
will doubtless find no lack of tasks to do, each one more arduous
and more helpful to man than any labor of his mythical prototype.</p>

<p>To the chemist the possibilities thus opened are innumerable.
Pictet has shown that at the low temperatures which are now
easily attainable all chemical action stops, even the most energetic
substances lying in contact with each other quiet and inert. A
greater control of the more violent chemical reactions is therefore
within reach, doubtless to be utilized in many ways yet unforeseen.
At the highest temperatures, also, chemical union ceases, and compounds
are decomposed; each reaction is possible only within a
limited thermal range, of which the beginning and the end are
measurable. From future measurements of this sort new laws will
surely be discovered.</p>

<p>The first step in the upward scale of temperatures was taken
in 1802, when Robert Hare, an American, invented the oxyhydrogen
blowpipe. With this instrument platinum, hitherto infusible,
was melted, a result of great importance to chemists. Apart from
recent electrical applications, platinum finds its chief use in the
construction of chemical apparatus, and Hare’s invention was therefore
of great assistance to chemical research. Later in the century
electrical currents were utilized as producers of great heat,
until in the very modern device of the electric furnace the range
of available temperatures has been at least doubled. Temperatures
of three to four thousand degrees of the centigrade scale are
now at the disposal of the chemist, and these are manageable in
compact apparatus at very moderate cost. Cheap aluminum is one
of the products of this new instrument, and the extraordinary abrasive
substance, carborundum, is another. New industries have been
created by the electric furnace, and in the hands of Moissan it has
yielded scientific results of great interest and remarkable variety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
The rarest metals can now be separated from their oxides with perfect
ease, and new compounds, obtainable in no other way, the
furnace has placed at our disposal. This field of research is now
barely opened; from it the twentieth century should gather a rich
harvest.</p>

<p>With electricity also chemistry is nearly allied, and along some
lines the two branches of science have been curiously intertwined.
Like the other physical forces, electricity may either provoke
or undo combination, and, like heat, it may itself be generated as
a product of chemical action. The voltaic pile and the galvanic
battery owe their currents to chemical change, and it is only since
the middle of the century that any other source of electric energy
has become available for practical purposes. It is not surprising,
therefore, that many thinkers should have sought to identify chemical
and electric force, the two have so much in common. It was
with the galvanic current that Davy decomposed the alkalies, and
since his day other electro-chemical decompositions have been studied
in great number, to the development of important industries.
To the action of the current upon metallic solutions we owe the
electrotype and all our processes for electroplating, and these
represent only the beginnings of usefulness. Even now, almost
daily, advances are being made in the practical applications of
electrolysis, and the forward movement is likely to continue
throughout the coming century. From the curiously reversible
chemical reactions of the secondary battery the automobile derives
its power, and here again we find a field for invention so large that
its limits are beyond our sight. From every peak that science can
scale new ranges come into view. The solution of one problem
always creates another, and this fact gives to scientific investigation
its chief interest. We gain, only to see that more gain is possible;
the opportunity for advance is infinite. Forever and ever thought
can reach out into the unknown, and never need to weep because
there are no more worlds to conquer.</p>

<p>It was the study of electro-chemical changes which led Berzelius
to his electro-chemical theory of combination, and then to
the dualistic theory, which has already been mentioned. In or
about the year 1832, when the Berzelian doctrines were at the
summit of their fame, Faraday showed that the chemical power of
a current was directly proportioned to the quantity of electricity
which passed, and this led him to believe that chemical affinity and
electric energy were identical. Electrolysis, the electrical decomposition
of compounds in solution, was a special object of his attention,
and by quantitative methods he found that the changes produced
could be stated in terms of chemical equivalents or combining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
numbers. One equivalent weight of zinc consumed in the galvanic
battery yields a current which will deposit one equivalent of
silver from its solution, or which, decomposing water, will liberate
one equivalent each of oxygen and hydrogen. All electro-chemical
changes followed this simple law, which gave new emphasis to the
atomic theory, and furnished a new means for measuring the combining
numbers.</p>

<p>In the early days of electro-chemistry the products of electrolysis
were studied in the light of the dualistic theory. But as chemical
investigation along other lines overthrew this hypothesis, a
closer examination of electrolytic reactions became necessary.
Electrical decompositions were dualistic in character, but the dualism
was not that taught by Berzelius. When a salt, dissolved in
water, is decomposed by the current it is separated into two parts,
which Faraday called its <i>ions</i>; in Berzelian terms these were in
most cases oxides, but this conclusion fitted only a part of the facts,
and finally was abandoned. Whatever the <i>ions</i> might be, they
were not ordinary oxides.</p>

<p>Many and long were the investigations bearing upon this subject
before a satisfactory settlement was reached. The phenomena
observed in solutions, raised still another question, that of the
nature of solution itself, and this is not yet fully answered. Two
lines of study, however, have converged, within recent years, to
some remarkable conclusions, the latest large development of chemical
theory.</p>

<p>It has long been known that solutions of salts do not freeze
so easily as pure water, and also that their boiling points are higher.
In 1883 Raoult discovered a remarkable relation between the freezing
point of a solution and the molecular weight of the substance
dissolved, a relation which has since been elaborately studied by
many investigators. From either the freezing-point depression or
the elevation of the boiling point the molecular weight of a soluble
compound can now be calculated, and many uncertain molecular
weights have thus been determined.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon connected with solutions, which has received
much attention, is that of osmotic pressure. A salt in solution
exercises a definite pressure, quantitatively measurable, which
is curiously analogous to the pressure exerted by gases. In a gas
the molecules are widely separated, and move about with much
freedom. In a very dilute solution the molecules of a salt are
similarly separated, and are also comparatively free to move. The
kinetic theory of gases, therefore, is now paralleled by a kinetic
theory of solutions, founded by Van t’Hoff in 1887, which is
now generally accepted. All the well-established laws connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
pressure, temperature, and volume among gases find their equivalents
in the phenomena exhibited by solutions. In Avogadro’s
law we learn that equal volumes of gases, under like conditions of
temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules.
According to the new generalizations, equal volumes of different
solutions, <i>if they exert the same osmotic pressure</i>, also contain equal
numbers of molecules. The parallelism is perfect. With these
relations the freezing- and boiling-point phenomena are directly
connected.</p>

<p>But, both for gases and for solutions some apparent anomalies
existed. Certain compounds, when vaporized, seemed not to conform
to Avogadro’s law, and called for explanation. This proved
to be simple, and was supplied by the fact that the anomalous compound,
as such, did not exist as vapor, but was split up, <i>dissociated</i>,
into other things. For instance, ammonium chloride, above a certain
temperature, is decomposed into a mixture of two gases&mdash;hydrochloric
acid and ammonia&mdash;which, on cooling, reunite and reproduce
the original compound. Twice as much vapor as is required
by theory, and specifically half as heavy, is produced by this transformation,
which is only one of a large class, all well understood.</p>

<p>In the case of solutions it was found that certain compounds,
notably the acids, alkalies, and metallic salts, caused a depression
of freezing point which was twice as great as ought to be expected.
This fact was illuminated by the phenomena observed in gases,
and soon it was seen that here too a splitting up of molecules, a
true dissociation, occurred. These anomalous solutions, moreover,
were electrolytes&mdash;that is, they conducted electricity and underwent
electrolytic decompositions&mdash;while normal substances, especially
solutions of carbon compounds, such as sugar, were not.</p>

<p>Van t’Hoff’s discoveries went far, but one more step was needed,
and this was taken by Arrhenius in 1888. Electrolytic compounds,
when dissolved, are actually dissociated into their <i>ions</i>, partially so
in a strong solution, entirely so in one which is infinitely dilute,
a statement which leads to some extraordinary conclusions. For
instance, the <i>ions</i> of common salt are sodium and chlorine. In a
dilute solution the salt itself ceases to exist, while atoms of sodium
and atoms of chlorine wander about, chemically separated from
each other but still in equilibrium. Sodium sulphate may be regarded
as made up of two parts&mdash;sodium and an acid radicle which
contains one atom of sulphur to four of oxygen&mdash;and these parts,
its <i>ions</i>, are severed apart during solution to move about independent
of each other.</p>

<p>This theory of Arrhenius, the theory of electrolytic dissociation,
is supported by many facts, and fits in well with the kinetic theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of Van t’Hoff. Electrolysis is no longer to be considered as a
separating process, but rather as a sorting of the <i>ions</i>, which receive
different electrical charges and concentrate at the two electrical
poles. The phenomena of freezing and boiling points in solutions,
and of the absorption of heat when solid salts are dissolved, all harmonize
with the conclusions which have been reached. A complete
theory of solutions is yet to be proposed; but these new doctrines,
which are true so far as they go, represent a long step in
the right direction. A final theory will include them, but they are
not likely to be set aside.</p>

<p>As we near the end of the century we find one more discovery
to note, from a most unexpected quarter&mdash;the discovery of
new gases in the atmosphere. In 1893 Lord Rayleigh was at work
upon new determinations of density, with regard to the more important
gases. In the case of nitrogen an anomaly appeared:
nitrogen obtained from the atmosphere was found to be very
slightly heavier than that prepared from chemical sources, but the
difference was so slight that it might almost have been ignored.
To Rayleigh, however, such a procedure was inadmissible, and he
sought for an explanation of his results. Joining forces with Ramsay,
the observed discrepancies were hunted down, and in 1894 the
discovery of argon was announced. Ramsay soon found in certain
rare minerals another new gas&mdash;helium&mdash;whose spectral lines had
previously been noted in the spectrum of the sun; and still later,
working with liquid air, he discovered four more of these strange
elements&mdash;krypton, xenon, neon, and metargon. By extreme accuracy
of measurement this chain of discovery was started, and,
as some one has aptly said, it represents the triumph of the third
decimal. A noble dissatisfaction with merely approximate data
was the motive which initiated the work.</p>

<p>To the chemist these new gases are sorely puzzling. They come
from a field which was thought to be exhausted, and cause us to
wonder why they were not found before. The reason for the oversight
is plain: the gases are devoid of chemical properties, at least
none have yet been certainly observed. They are colorless, tasteless,
odorless, inert; so far they have been found to be incapable
of union with other elements; apart from some doubtful experiments
of Berthelot, they form no chemical compounds. Under
the periodic law they are difficult to classify; they seem to belong
nowhere; they simply exist, unsocial, alone. Only by their density,
their spectra, and some physical properties can these intractable
new forms of matter be identified.</p>

<p>In a sketch like this a host of discoveries must remain unnoticed,
and others can be barely mentioned. The isolation of fluorine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the manufacture of diamonds by Moissan, the synthesis of sugars
by Fischer, the discovery of soluble forms of silver by Carey Lea&mdash;all
these achievements and many more must be passed over. Something,
however, needs to be said upon the utilitarian aspects of
chemistry, and concerning its influence upon other sciences. Portions
of this field have been touched in the preceding pages; the
interdependence of chemistry and physics is already evident; other
subjects now demand our attention.</p>

<p>Medicine and physiology are both debtors to chemistry for
much of their advancement, and in more than one way. From the
chemist medicine has received a host of new remedies, some new
processes, and advanced methods for the diagnosis of disease. The
staining of tissues for identification under the microscope is effected
by chemical agents, the analysis of urine helps to identify disorders
of the kidneys; nitrous oxide, chloroform, ether, and cocaine almost
abolish pain. The disinfection of the sick-room and the antiseptic
methods which go far toward the creation of modern surgery all
depend upon chemical products whose long list increases year by
year. Crude drugs are now replaced by active principles discovered
in the laboratory&mdash;morphine, quinine, and the like&mdash;and instead
of the bulky, nauseous draughts of olden time, the invalid is
given tasteless capsules of gelatin or compressed tablets of uniform
strength and more accurately graded power. A great part of
physiology consists of the study of chemical processes, the transformation
of compounds within the living organism, and practically
all this advance is the creation of the nineteenth century. Modern
bacteriology, at least in its practical applications, began with
a chemical discussion between Liebig and Pasteur as to the nature
of fermentation: step by step the field of exploration has enlarged;
as the result of the investigations we have preventive medicine,
more perfect sanitation, and antiseptic surgery. The ptomaines
which cause disease and the antitoxins which prevent it are alike
chemical in their nature, and were discovered by chemical methods.
Physiology without chemistry could not exist; even the phenomena
of respiration were meaningless before the discovery of oxygen.
The human body is a chemical laboratory, and without the aid of
the chemist its mysteries can not be unraveled.</p>

<p>To agriculture also chemistry is a potent ally, whose value can
hardly be overrated. It has created fertilizers and insecticides for
the use of the farmer and taught their intelligent use, and in the
many experiment stations of the world it is daily discovering facts
or principles which are practically applicable to agriculture. The
beet-sugar industry was developed by chemical researches and chemical
methods; the arts of the dairy have been chemically improved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the food of all civilized nations is better and more abundant than
it was before the chemist gave his aid to its production. Adulteration,
always practiced, is now easily detected by chemical analysis,
and, though the evil still exists, the remedy for it is in sight.
To Liebig, who gave to agricultural chemistry its first great impulse
forward, mankind is indebted to an amount which is beyond all
computation.</p>

<p>In manufactures the influence of chemistry is seen at every
turn. When the century began, probably no industrial establishment
in the world dreamed of maintaining a chemical laboratory;
to-day, hundreds are well equipped and often heavily manned for
the sole benefit of the intelligent manufacturer. Coal gas is a
chemical product; its by-products are ammonia and coal tar; from
the latter, as we have seen, hundreds of useful substances, the discoveries
of the last half century, are prepared. Better and cheaper
soap and glass owe their existence to chemical improvement in the
making of alkalies; chemical bleaching has replaced the tedious
action of sunlight and dew; chemical dyestuffs give our modern
fabrics nearly all their hues. Metallurgy is almost wholly a group
of chemical processes; every metal is extracted from its ores by
methods which rest on chemical foundations; analyses of fuel, flux,
and product go on side by side with the smelting. The cyanide and
chlorination processes for gold, the Bessemer process for steel, are
apt illustrations of the advances in chemical metallurgy; but before
these come into play the dynamite of the miner, another chemical
invention, must have done its work underground. For rare
minerals, the mere curiosities of twenty years ago, uses have been
found; from monazite we obtain the oxides which form the mantle
of the Welsbach burner; from beauxite, aluminum is made. The
former waste products of many an industry have also revealed
unsuspected values, and chemistry has the sole honor of their
discovery.</p>

<p>In education, chemistry has steadily grown in importance, until
a single university may have need of as many as twenty chemists
in its teaching staff, teaching not only what is already known, but
also the art of research. As a disciplinary study, chemistry ranks
high in the college curriculum, and it opens the way to a new
learned profession, equal in rank with those of more ancient
standing.</p>

<p>For the material advancement of mankind the nineteenth century
has done more than all the preceding ages combined, and science
has been the chief instrument of progress. Scientific methods,
experimental investigation, have replaced the old empiricism,
and no man can imagine where the forward movement is to end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Hitherto research has been sporadic, individual, unorganized; but
fruitful beyond all anticipation. In the future it should become
more systematic, better organized, richer in facilities. Through
laboratories equipped for research alone the twentieth century must
work, and chemistry is entitled to its fair share of the coming opportunities.
The achievements of the chemist, great as they have
been during this century, are but a beginning; the larger possibilities
are ahead. The greatest laws are yet undiscovered; the
invitation of the unknown was never more distinct than now.</p>

<h2 title="Mount Tamalpais" id="mount">MOUNT TAMALPAIS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By MARSDEN MANSON, C.&nbsp;E., Ph.D.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Mount</span> Tamalpais is the southern and terminating peak
of the westerly ridge of the Coast Range, which confronts
the Pacific Ocean from the Golden Gate to the Oregon line.</p>

<p>Its outliers form the bold headlands which skirt the Golden
Gate and adjacent waters to the north, and which bound the peninsula
constituting Marin County. The spurs extending to the east
reach the shores of the Bay of San Francisco, and inclose small
alluvial valleys of great fertility and beauty. In some instances
these valley lands are fringed by tidal marshes, in part reclaimed
and under cultivation.</p>

<p>The top of the mountain breaks into three distinct peaks, each
reaching an altitude of nearly half a mile above sea level, although
bounded on three sides by tidal waters.</p>

<p>No land points visible from the summit, except those bounding
the apparent horizon, reach equal or greater altitude. The mountain
is therefore a marked feature from all parts of the area visible
from its summit, which area has an extent of about eight thousand
square miles.</p>

<p>The adjoined photographic reproduction of a portion of a relief
map of the State gives a general idea of the adjacent land, bay,
and ocean areas.</p>

<p>The westerly group of islands, opposite the Golden Gate, are
the Farallones. The bold headland northwest of the Gate is Point
Reyes; it protects from the north and northwest winds the anchorage
known as Drake’s Bay. The strip of water between the adjoining
peninsula and the mainland is Tomales Bay.</p>

<p>The most westerly headland south of the Golden Gate is San
Pedro Point, and the prominent headland farther south is Pescadero
Point. The whole of San Francisco Bay is visible from Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Tamalpais, except a few sheltered nooks and portions behind
islands.</p>

<div id="ip_70" class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
  <img src="images/illo_076.jpg" width="418" height="248" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Vicinity of the Golden Gate.</span></div></div>

<p>The tidal area inside the Golden Gate is about seven hundred
and forty square miles at high tide; this includes that portion which
extends east of the Coast Range into the valley of California, and
known as Suisun Bay; this bay is connected with San Francisco
Bay through the Straits of Carquinez and San Pablo Bay. Emptying
into Suisun Bay at its easterly end are the Sacramento and San
Joaquin Rivers. Thus the tidal waters washing the base of Mount
Tamalpais are connected with the interior valley of California, and
tributary to them are about twelve hundred miles of navigable
channels, tapping the central part of the State.</p>

<p>From the summit of this peak the eye sweeps the horizon of
the Pacific Ocean for nearly one hundred and fifty degrees. To
the northwest, north, and northeast lie Petaluma, Santa Rosa,
Sonoma, and Napa Valleys, the view over these being bounded by
the ridges inclosing them. To the east are the Straits of Carquinez,
the outlet of the fifty-eight thousand square miles of drainage
of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, and the only water
gap in the entire perimeter.</p>

<p>From the east to the south lie the slopes of the Contra Costa
Hills and the ranges bounding the drainage into the Bay of San
Francisco, and including the Santa Clara Valley, thus embracing a
magnificent view of the garden spots of California, and the cities
and towns around the bay&mdash;the homes of about one third the population
of the State. Three prominent peaks mark the limits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
land view: Mount Hamilton, the site of the Lick Observatory of
the University of California; Mount Diablo, the base and meridian
of the United States land surveys of central California; and
Mount St. Helena, a volcanic peak the summit of which is common
to Napa, Sonoma, and Lake Counties, and whose spurs are noted
for their quicksilver mines, mineral and hot springs.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Map showing Location of Railroad from Mill Valley to Summit of Mount
Tamalpais.</span></div></div>

<p>The plant life of the immediate Tamalpais region is abundant
and interesting; the flowering plants are represented by about
eighty orders, three hundred and fifty genera, and from seven to
eight hundred species, of which about one hundred are trees and
<span class="locked">shrubs.<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></span> Some of the Sierra forms occur on Mount Tamalpais,
and it is also the locus of the most southerly extension of certain
boreal species. Owing to the wide range of temperature, moisture
conditions, and exposures, many of these plants can be found in
bloom during every week in the year. During the warm, moist
autumn and winter the hardiest species bloom from October to
April in protected areas, and in the cold, exposed areas these same
species require the heat of the season from April to September to
bring them into bloom. Thus, within a radius of four or five miles
from the summit there is not a week in the year when the flowers
of certain species can not be gathered&mdash;this in face of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
during the months of December, January, and February the summit
may be covered with sleet or snow for a day or two at a time.</p>

Academy of Sciences.</p></div>

<p>Mount Tamalpais is therefore a point of great interest to the
sight-seer, the tourist, and the student of Nature.</p>

  <div class="caption">View of Summit from a Point Sixteen Hundred Feet above Tide.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Modes of reaching the Summit.</span>&mdash;For many years a trail has
existed from Mill Valley to the summit, and another from Ross
Valley, both practicable for pack mules. Later the Ross Valley
trail was improved so as to be practicable for light vehicles, but
these did not answer the needs of the increasing travel, and in
1895 the Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway Company
was organized. The purpose of this company was bold&mdash;to
construct a traction railroad from tide level to the summit of a
peak not two miles off and nearly half a mile high appeared visionary,
if not impossible, to many. But with persevering skill a
road was located upon a line 8.19 miles long, having an average
grade of five and a half per cent and maximum grades of seven
per cent, and overcoming 2,353 feet elevation in this distance.
Four and nine tenths miles are curved, the minimum radius being
seventy feet. Owing to the rough and ravine-cut topography,
twenty-five trestles were necessary, the curvature and grade being
maintained over these.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the cost of grading and to develop sufficient
length to overcome the elevation, the grade contour was
followed as closely as possible. The very short radius employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
permitted this to be done without tunnels and with but two
through cuts.</p>

<p>The accompanying map, prepared from the United States Coast
and Geodetic charts and the maps and profiles of the company, gives
a general idea of the location and main features. To the student
of railroad location it forms an interesting exhibit of the extreme
flexibility of railway location.</p>

<p>The rails are steel, fifty-seven pounds to the yard, laid to
standard gauge upon the ordinary redwood ties in use on the
Pacific coast. Grading, trestle work, and laying cost about
$55,000. The entire road cost $136,746.44, or practically $16,700
per mile.</p>

<p>The equipment consists of one thirty-ton geared locomotive
(Heisler), one twenty-ton geared locomotive (Shay), six open canopy-top
observation cars, one half-closed passenger car, and two flat
cars. Cost of equipment, <span class="locked">$22,450.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></span></p>

<p>The locomotives and cars are very thoroughly provided with
brakes: first, the Westinghouse automatic air brake; second, a
water brake; and, third, a powerful hand brake to each locomotive
and car. The efficiency of this equipment is attested in the operation
of the road without accident or injury of any kind. The locomotives
are always operated on the lower end of trains, and the
maximum speed allowed is eight miles per hour.</p>

<p>The ride up the winding cañons and through the superb scenery
traversed by this road is a treat of which one never tires. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
point of view, the direction, and the character of the landscape
are continually changing. With no deep cuts, no tunnels, facing
first one and then the other and finally all the points of the compass,
sweeping around spurs, with distant views of land and sea, and
near views of great beauty; then facing the steep sides of the
mountain, its geology and flora affording interesting pictures; then
over trestles with the branches of the bay, redwood, madroño, oak,
and manzanita just out of reach&mdash;all these form beauties and
attractions possessed by no other road known to the writer. A
faint idea of the appearance of the road and of the scenery may
be had from the appended photographs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Meteorological Station.</span>&mdash;The advantages of Mount Tamalpais
as a meteorological station have long been recognized, and
many efforts have been made to utilize them. It frequently projects
many hundreds of feet above fogs which cover the adjacent
shores, and during these periods one can look out upon an ocean
of rolling, fleecy clouds which break upon the mountains around
its base and visible from its summit. This freedom from obscuring
conditions gives an opportunity to more freely observe and study
meteorological phenomena, and caused the Weather Bureau to
make a series of preliminary observations in 1897, and, these resulting
favorably, a fully equipped permanent station was subsequently
built. The results have fully equaled expectations.
The advantages of the location may be briefly summarized as
follows:</p>

<p>1. It is close to the coast line, and is so elevated that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
not seriously affected by the local indraught of air through the
Golden Gate and adjacent gaps in the Coast Range. This local
indraught is a disturbing and often a misleading factor in all observations
taken near and south of the Golden Gate for at least a
score of miles. The elevated station on top of the peak eliminates
the source of errors based upon observations at lower stations, and
enables the forecast official to determine the effects of the local
disturbances, and thus to give observations taken at or near sea
level their true weight at the proper time.</p>

<p>2. No station in the United States has so full and free a projection
into the lower third of the vapor-bearing stratum as has
the station on this peak. No other station furnishes, as it does, an
opportunity to study the distribution of vapor in the lower third
of that stratum of the atmosphere, the physics of which is most
important to human life and industries.</p>

<p>3. In studying the phenomena connected with the occurrence
of fog, this station furnishes highly valuable data that could be
obtained from no other; and, again, enables the student of weather
lore to correct misleading impressions and deductions based upon
observations taken below the one-thousand-foot contour above
sea level.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1899, the observations taken on Mount
Tamalpais marked a difference of about thirty degrees in temperature
over those around its base. In San Francisco, at Point
Lobos and at Point Reyes, the temperature was down to 48°, while
on Mount Tamalpais it was 79°, thus marking an approaching
change in weather conditions, and giving the Weather Bureau
the first opportunity of using the vertical temperature gradient
in forecasting.</p>

<p>As a station for furnishing the data for a study of the problems
of the physics of the atmosphere Mount Tamalpais is of further
importance, as it stands near the easterly limits of the great area
of high pressure which, during summer, lies over the North Pacific
and which dominates the climatic phenomena of California for the
greater portion of the year.</p>

<p>Stations on the Hawaiian Islands to the south and others on
the Aleutian Islands to the north of this area of high pressure will
still further aid in the solution of the great and vital problems
now before meteorologists. These stations are the most reliable
ones which can surround on three sides the two great “weather
breeders”&mdash;the “summer high” and the “winter low” of the
North Pacific.</p>

<h2 title="International Law and the Peace Conference" id="international">INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE PEACE CONFERENCE.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By JAMES HARRIS VICKERY, LL. B.</span></span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“In truth these ‘cut-and-dried’ schemes are of no value at all, unless as monuments of
the mingled simplicity and ingenuity of their authors.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lawrence.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> view has been very generally entertained that all efforts
to promote the cause of peace and order in the world by cut-and-dried
schemes are bound to fail, and it must be admitted that
few truer words have been written than those which stand at the
head of this article. But this truth, like some others, may be
abused. Evidences are not wanting to show that the incredulity
which preceded the convening of the Peace Conference, the skepticism
which marked its first sessions, and a certain want of faith
which has since been manifested in various quarters in the practical
value of the measures adopted, are all mainly due to a misapplication
of this truth.</p>

<p>The measures formulated at The Hague do not constitute a
“cut-and-dried scheme,” but, on the contrary, they form an additional
step in a natural, healthy, and orderly evolution of the forces
of peace which have so effectively asserted themselves in the improvement
of international relations during the latter half of this
<span class="locked">century.<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Geneva Red Cross Rules.</span>&mdash;The first matter to which
attention will be invited is the extension of the Red Cross rules to
naval warfare.</p>

<p>The Geneva Convention of 1864, which marks the beginning
of the organization known as the Red Cross Society, inaugurated a
vast and beneficent improvement in the then existing usage of
nations as regarded the care of the sick and wounded in war. Its
two salient features are the neutralization of the officers and forces
of the society and the disabled soldiers under their care, and the
establishment of a <i>system</i> to govern the conduct of its humane
work.</p>

<p>At the dawn of modern international law during the first quarter
of the seventeenth century not only the sick and wounded of
a vanquished foe, but every prisoner, and even women and children,
suffered to the fullest the indignities and cruelties incident to the
rough warfare of the age; but the growth of mercy has softened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the asperities of war, and among the milestones that mark this
advance toward a more humane usage the Red Cross Society holds
an honored place. Under its rules the sick and wounded were no
longer left to the irregular and capricious care of private benevolence,
but were made the subject of organized and systematic treatment
by a staff of skilled physicians and experienced nurses provided
with hospital and ambulance facilities, and, thus equipped
and assured the protection of both combatants, they were able to
work effectively in their ministrations to the sick and dying.</p>

<p>Vast as was this progress from the days when at the siege of
Acre the first real attention since the dark ages was given to the
wounded by the Order of Teutonic Knights, there was still one
serious imperfection that limited its sphere of usefulness&mdash;it did
not apply to warfare on the seas. An effort had indeed been made
in 1868 to extend the Red Cross rules to naval warfare, but it
failed, and the wounded in conflicts on the sea continued to be left
to the old provisions, which were necessarily inadequate and could
not be exercised under the joint protection of the combatants.
The virtue of the good Samaritan is a potent force, but to be fully
effective on the field of battle it must be exercised under a common
system established and maintained by the mutual consent of nations.
It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that because the
effort made in 1868 to extend these rules to sea warfare failed on
account of their non-ratification, they were not sustained by public
opinion. Many difficulties, especially those of a technical character,
stood in the way; but public opinion was ever growing in their
favor, and it eventually came to be regarded as an anomaly that
while the care of the sick and wounded in land warfare had been
regulated upon a common basis of international agreement, no
similar provision existed for the care of the victims of naval combat.
Without some such extension of the rules no adequate expression
could be given to the growing humanity of the age.</p>

<p>For these reasons it will be obvious that the next step necessary
in the further development of the Red Cross work consisted of its
extension to naval warfare. The Peace Conference subjected the
Convention of 1864 and the additional rules of 1868 to a careful
examination, considered at length the difficulties in the way, and
finally adopted a new series of rules providing for an organized
staff of physicians and nurses, with hospital ships and life-saving
appliances, which shall, without interfering with operations, be
henceforth employed in naval engagements and enjoy the protection
of both combatants.</p>

<p>The newly formulated rules, in conjunction with the previous
ones relating to land warfare, are the practical embodiment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
growing feelings of humanity and mercy in the conduct of warfare
which, commencing with the Peace of Westphalia, has been ever
more and more effective in securing the evolution of a better usage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brussels Rules.</span>&mdash;So, too, with reference to the rules governing
the conduct of armies in the field the work of the conference
represents a sound and healthy evolution.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, by way of preface, that the old idea of
war regarded hostilities as working the absolute interruption of
all relations between belligerents, save those arising from force;
it also regarded the enemy as a proper object of violence and depredation.
Even in the time of Grotius the universal usage permitted
the putting to death of all persons found in the enemy’s territory,
and in the terrible struggles of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany
and the Eighty Years’ War in the Netherlands the story of the
fate of men, women, and children at the hands of a conquering
soldiery forms one of the darkest chapters in human history.</p>

<p>But while Grotius declared this to be the usage, he also took
care to point out that considerations of justice and mercy dictate
a better course, and he made a distinction between certain classes,
declaring that justice requires the belligerent to spare those who
have done no wrong to him, especially old men, priests, husbandmen,
merchants, prisoners, women, and children. This merciful
distinction was eagerly seized upon by his successors, who gradually
developed out of it different rules for the treatment of the “combatant”
and “non-combatant” portion of the enemy inhabitants.
After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which marked the close
of the great struggles that had so long convulsed Europe, the older
and more brutal customs fell into disuse, and the theory that only
so much stress should be put upon an enemy, and primarily upon
the combatant portion, as was sufficient to destroy his power of
resistance was substituted for it. Along with this new usage grew
the ever-increasing rights of neutrals, among them being that of
trade and commerce with the non-combatant portion of belligerent
states, which has done so much to lighten the hardships of war
suffered by those devoted to peaceful pursuits in the enemy’s
territory.</p>

<p>The next important step in this evolution belongs to the present
century, and is due to the enlightened initiative of the United
States. This step consisted in the preparation of a manual containing
a code of rules for the conduct of land warfare. Keenly
alive to the inevitable sufferings incident to the great civil conflict
then being waged, Abraham Lincoln commissioned Francis Lieber
to prepare a series of rules for the conduct of the armies of the
republic in the field which should set bounds to the passions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the <span class="locked">soldiery.<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a></span> In pursuance of this commission, a code of rules
was prepared and adopted which has since been known as Lieber’s
Manual; it was published in 1863, and proved a blessing to soldier
and civilian alike. So obvious, indeed, were its good results that
other nations rapidly followed the lead of the United States, and
similar manuals were issued by Great Britain, France, Germany,
Russia, and other powers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I" id="Footnote_I" href="#FNanchor_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> See Pierantoni, Die Fortschritte des Völkerrechts im neunzehnten Jahrhundert.</p></div>

<p>But while Lieber’s Manual was thus taken as the model by
various nations, there were inevitably developed serious divergencies
in the rules and details. Recognizing the desirability of a common
code, which should be binding upon all nations, Alexander II
of Russia attempted to secure the united action of the leading
states, and, pursuant to his initiative, the Conference of Brussels
was called in 1874. In the sessions of this conference the rules
already developed were carefully examined, and ultimately a series
of articles, well calculated to form the basis for an excellent international
code, was adopted. As the delegates, however, had not
been given plenary powers by their respective governments, their
action was necessarily ineffective without subsequent ratification.
Upon this rock the conference was wrecked, and the rules which
it had formulated acquired no binding authority.</p>

<p>But indirectly they had a most happy effect, for they worked
as a unifying influence in the preparation of subsequent manuals
and the amendment of existing ones. The increasing interest in
the subject thus stimulated led the Institute of International Law
to give the matter still further thought, with the result that that
eminent body of jurists in 1880 adopted a very full and excellent
code, which gave evidence of much advance in the knowledge of
the subject.</p>

<p>But neither the Brussels rules nor the code of the Institute of
International Law possessed any binding authority, save in so far
as they embodied generally accepted usage; their influence, however,
increased the tendency in the direction of a common manual
such as that which Alexander II had hoped to secure&mdash;a hope which
has now been realized, and in a manner worthy of the subject.
This logical step, too long delayed, is due to the Peace Conference.
It devoted most careful consideration to the various codes, and
has enriched, extended, and unified the rules and improved the
whole by many valuable provisions suggested by the intervening
experience. Altogether, the result is a splendid example of a natural
evolution which, commencing with the distinction between
“combatant” and “non-combatant” founded on the considerations
of mercy and justice pleaded by Grotius, subsequently recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
in the Peace of Westphalia, increasingly practiced since then, and
at the instance of Lincoln embodied in a manual, has now led to
the adoption of a common international code for the conduct of
future armies in the field&mdash;a result which marks the triumph in
our day of the conception of civilized warfare tempered with mercy
over the old idea of indiscriminate and inhuman slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sphere of Arbitration.</span>&mdash;A matter that has given rise to
much speculation is the <i>jurisdiction</i> of arbitral tribunals. It has
come to be recognized that a distinction must be made between
different classes of international disputes. What may be called
“business disputes” between states, such as boundary lines, tariffs,
damages, fishery claims, questions of citizenship, and various treaty
arrangements&mdash;like the most-favored nation clause&mdash;are all fit subjects
for <span class="locked">arbitration.<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a></span> But the graver questions involving the consideration
of national policy and aspirations, vital interests and
honor, race and religious prejudices and passions, and last of all
self-preservation, are, at least for the present, far beyond the competence
of an arbitration <span class="locked">tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J" id="Footnote_J" href="#FNanchor_J" class="fnanchor">J</a> See Essai sur l’Organisation de l’Arbitrage International, by M. Descamps, p. 24.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_K" id="Footnote_K" href="#FNanchor_K" class="fnanchor">K</a> The Transvaal War pertinently illustrates the prevailing want of knowledge regarding
the true sphere of arbitration. Ever since the outbreak of war the Continental press and
some American papers have been asking why the provisions of the Peace Conference are
not put in operation. Much of this is due to anglophobia; much to a genuine ignorance of
the matter. The treatment of the subject usually takes the form of an antithesis in which
Great Britain as a peace power at the conference is contrasted with Greater Britain making
war on a little republic, and this is invariably followed with a statement or inference that
the Peace Conference was a huge farce, and the Permanent Court a dire failure. It is now
quite plain that the root of the difficulty between England and the Transvaal was not the
franchise nor the dynamite monopoly, but English <i>versus</i> Dutch predominancy in the whole
of South Africa, and therefore a grave clash of two opposing policies, involving the deepest
questions of interest and even self-preservation. Regarding these questions the conference
was unanimous in the opinion that they are entirely outside the sphere of arbitrable
question.</p></div>

<p>If the list of arbitral decisions hitherto given be examined it
will show that questions of the first sort above are those which
have thus far been submitted to judicial <span class="locked">settlement.<a name="FNanchor_L" id="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">L</a></span> It is therefore
in harmony with past experience that the conference, in generally
defining the scope of arbitration, declared it to be intended
for the settlement of “questions of a juridical nature,” especially
the interpretation and application of international agreements upon
the basis of respect for <span class="locked">law.<a name="FNanchor_M" id="FNanchor_M" href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor">M</a></span> The frequency of these “business
questions” is on the increase; they seriously embarrass diplomatic
representatives, whose proper duty is the conduct of graver matters
of policy, and there is a growing disposition to submit them to legal
settlement. Under these circumstances, there is little doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the time has come when the system of special temporary courts of
arbitration, splendid as their work has been, must give way to a
more adequate system&mdash;they were indeed but stepping stones to
a more permanent organization. Under the old system each power
was likely to wait for the other to take the initiative; then came
a squabble as to just how much and what part of the difficulty should
be submitted to arbitration, then a squabble about judges, then a
squabble about procedure, place of trial, and so on&mdash;all was unpreparedness,
uncertainty, and meantime angry passions had full play.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>In the preparation for war the modern state lays no end of
force on the necessity for a rapid and systematic mobilization. The
weak point, however, in preparing for a judicial contest hitherto
has been the absence of any system by which to “mobilize judges
and counsel” and get the legal forces out into the field. To attain
this end the scheme presented by Lord Pauncefote and unanimously
adopted by the conference will be found to be a most striking example
of the happy adaptation of a means to an end where the way
seemed blocked by infinite difficulties. It consists of a few simple
provisions for the establishment of an International Bureau of Arbitration
with an Administrative Council, and this, with the addition
of various other features drawn from the United States, Russia,
France, and Italy, with some others, constitutes the composite plan
embodied in the Final Act. In brief outline it is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Permanent Court of Arbitration.</span>&mdash;The diplomatic representatives
of the signatory powers accredited to The Hague, including
the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs as <span class="locked">president,<a name="FNanchor_N" id="FNanchor_N" href="#Footnote_N" class="fnanchor">N</a></span> are to
constitute an administrative council. This council shall organize
and establish an International Bureau of Arbitration, of which it
shall retain the direction and control, pursuant to the provisions
of the conference. This bureau shall serve as the office of the
court, and contain the archives, and the routine business shall
be conducted therein. The signatory powers will each appoint
four persons, who shall be men of recognized ability in international
law and of high character, and the whole number of persons
so appointed shall form a list or panel of members of the court, or
the international bench. In case of a difficulty arising between
two or more powers which they desire to submit to arbitration,
they agree to notify the bureau, and the bureau will ask them to
choose a certain number of judges from the panel, and these shall
constitute the special <span class="locked">bench.<a name="FNanchor_O" id="FNanchor_O" href="#Footnote_O" class="fnanchor">O</a></span> An agreement is then to be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
up stating the object of the litigation and the powers of the arbitrators.
This agreement implies the engagement of the parties to
submit in good faith to the sentence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_N" id="Footnote_N" href="#FNanchor_N" class="fnanchor">N</a> The amendment to Lord Pauncefote’s plan, by which the Dutch Foreign Minister was
made the president, is due to Mr. White, President of the American Commission.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_O" id="Footnote_O" href="#FNanchor_O" class="fnanchor">O</a> In case states, between whom a dispute may arise, do not of their own accord have
recourse to the tribunal, Section 27 permits the powers to remind
such states that the Permanent Court is open to them, and the giving of this reminder is declared to be a duty in
the superior interests of peace, and is to be regarded only as an exercise of “good offices.”
To this section the United States agreed on condition that its consent should not be regarded
as a departure from the well-known principles underlying the foreign policy of the Republic.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbitral Procedure.</span>&mdash;For the purpose of promoting the development
of arbitration certain simple rules are formulated. The
powers will appoint special agents, who shall be intermediaries between
them and the tribunal; they will also appoint counsel. The
proceedings consist first of <i>instruction</i>&mdash;communications by the
agents and counsel to the tribunal and the opposing party, of the
pleadings, etc.; and, secondly, of <i>argument</i>&mdash;the oral development
of the pleadings. The argument being closed, the bench shall deliberate
in secret, and a decision is to be reached by a majority vote.
The decision shall be written, and is to contain the reasons of law
and fact upon which it is based. In case of disagreement, the dissenting
opinion shall also be written and contain the reasons therefor;
the signature of each member is to be added to his opinion.
Subsequently the decision is to be read in open session, in the
presence of the agents and counsel of the parties.</p>

<p>To sum up: it contains all the essentials; it is immediately
available, provided with a permanent office, with officials, with a
code of procedure, with directions for the commencement of proceedings,
the presentation of cases, the taking of evidence by an
International Commission of Inquiry, the oral explanation and argument
of the printed case, the pronouncement of sentence in open
court, the recording of such decision, the subsequent rectification
of an error therein on the discovery of new and important facts
of a decisive character, and the preservation of the <span class="locked">records.<a name="FNanchor_P" id="FNanchor_P" href="#Footnote_P" class="fnanchor">P</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_P" id="Footnote_P" href="#FNanchor_P" class="fnanchor">P</a> See Articles XV to LVII of the Convention.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Basis for Future Evolution.</span>&mdash;With these essentials there is a
basis for a future evolution until the court shall have become as
perfect in its organization and details as the High Courts of Justice
in England or the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss here to suggest the influence which the
permanent tribunal is calculated to exercise in the future development
of international law. The provision for a permanent bureau
or record office, in which the archives shall be kept, is sure to
prove a valuable condition for future growth, for the deposit in
such bureau of all arbitral decisions will mark the true beginning
of what we may call “International Law Reports.” To this bureau
the powers undertake to send certified copies of all special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
arbitration agreements, whether embodied in treaties or otherwise;
to it also will be sent the result of all special arbitrations hereafter
resorted to, and in it will be deposited the papers, pleadings,
and other documents, and especially the decisions of the permanent
court, as well as those of any special courts which may hereafter
be created from time to time. These archives will thus furnish a
wealth of material not locked up or available only by jurists of the
particular state where they may happen to be situated, as has too
often been the case heretofore, but accessible alike to the great
text writers and commentators of all nations. The criticisms and
opinions of eminent text writers have heretofore been of great
value in the improvement of international law, and under these
new and more favorable conditions their influence should be even
more beneficial in the future.</p>

<p>To the works of text writers will in future be added the able
discussions of counsel and the learned opinions of judges handed
down in writing, with the reasons upon which they are <span class="locked">founded.<a name="FNanchor_Q" id="FNanchor_Q" href="#Footnote_Q" class="fnanchor">Q</a></span>
Where rules and usages are becoming obsolete or obviously hostile
to the growth of opinion, international judges may feel themselves
bound for a time by them and give their decisions accordingly, but
they may embody in their written decisions an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter dictum</i> which
shall prove the death knell of the old rule and the establishment
of a healthier one. Many are the wholesome changes that have
thus been wrought in English “judge-made law” as the direct result
of learned and convincing <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter dicta</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_Q" id="Footnote_Q" href="#FNanchor_Q" class="fnanchor">Q</a> For an admirable example, see the published proceedings of the Paris Tribunal in the
Venezuelan case.</p></div>

<p>The interest which will thus be stimulated in the whole subject
of international law will promote its study in all nations. Hitherto
this branch of legal education has been rather slighted; not
being regarded as essential to the ordinary practitioner, it has been
neglected for the petty provisions of some state code or involved
corporation law, but the influences already at work in favor of a
more thorough and scholarly study of this branch will be effectively
aided under the new conditions.</p>

<p>Though the law of nations should be uniform in all countries,
a comparison of the leading works in different countries, English
and German for instance, will reveal many differences partly traceable
to the particular system of law in which the author was
grounded, and in part to his peculiar “judicial instinct.” It is
not often that one finds an English or American lawyer thoroughly
grounded in the Roman system and the modern Continental systems
founded upon it; quite as rare is it to find a Continental lawyer
learned in the system of English jurisprudence. There have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
been such men, as, for example, Rudolf Gneist, whose great work
on English Constitutional Law and History has become a classic.
But, as a rule, there is among text writers on this branch of law
and among the eminent jurists who have hitherto been connected
with international tribunals much “provincialism in thought and
conception,” if the phrase may be allowed, and to overcome it the
future jurists who shall take part in international contests before
the high tribunal of the nations will require to be more thoroughly
grounded in the history and evolution of law in general and in the
study of comparative law, both private and public, in particular,
than their predecessors have <span class="locked">been.<a name="FNanchor_R" id="FNanchor_R" href="#Footnote_R" class="fnanchor">R</a></span> In this connection it is not too
much to hope that the unifying influence of an international tribunal
will eventually exercise a good effect in promoting the solution
of various perplexing problems on the private side of international
law, or what is known as “conflict of laws.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_R" id="Footnote_R" href="#FNanchor_R" class="fnanchor">R</a> As evidence of increased attention to this matter in Germany, see Wertheim, Wörterbuch
des Englischen Rechts.</p></div>

<p>Having indicated some directions in which the growth of international
law will be likely to be promoted by the tribunal, the question
suggests itself whether the jurisdiction of the international
court will eventually be enlarged beyond the scope at present contemplated
by the Convention of The Hague. Will the time ever
come when such a court shall take cognizance of various matters
which now lie without the sphere of “business disputes and questions
of a juridical nature” and within that of essential interests,
honor, race, and religious policies and ideals? The statement, which
is sometimes heard, that such will never be the case, does not seem
warranted when we regard the growth of law in general, and indeed
the development of this particular branch of it, in the past, but it is
safe to say that the time is a long way off; it will depend on many
things: the efficiency of the court itself, the continued growth of
neutral rights, the increasing necessity for preserving international
peace, and the infinite forces which have tended to widen the jurisdiction
of municipal <span class="locked">law.<a name="FNanchor_S" id="FNanchor_S" href="#Footnote_S" class="fnanchor">S</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_S" id="Footnote_S" href="#FNanchor_S" class="fnanchor">S</a> See Le Droit de la Paix, by M. Descamps.</p></div>

<p>In the growth of systems of “National <span class="locked">Law”<a name="FNanchor_T" id="FNanchor_T" href="#Footnote_T" class="fnanchor">T</a></span> there has been
evolved from small beginnings an ever-widening jurisdiction. Impartial
courts have inspired confidence which stimulated individuals
to seek their aid, and this has reacted to extend their jurisdiction,
until now the most intimate and complex relations between individuals,
at one time wholly without their sphere, are in these days
submitted as a matter of course to judicial settlement. Even questions
of individual honor are settled according to the well-developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
principles of libel and slander which were once considered as requiring
a duel for their satisfaction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_T" id="Footnote_T" href="#FNanchor_T" class="fnanchor">T</a> In contradistinction to “International Law.”</p></div>

<p>A similar growth may be expected in the jurisdiction of the
international tribunal. Upon the reputation which it shall succeed
in establishing for impartiality, freedom from race and national
prejudices, regard for broad principles of law and equity, and the
thoroughness and ability with which it shall discharge its high
duties within its present sphere, will largely depend the extent to
which an advancing public opinion will enlarge its jurisdiction until
it shall embrace various classes of questions now declared non-arbitrable.
No detailed classification, however, can be thought of;
each difficulty as it arises must be determined in view of the surrounding
circumstances with due regard to the growing public feeling
in favor of judicial settlement. Under the system of voluntary
arbitration there is abundant room for growth, for the <i>onus</i> will
be thrown on each contending state to square its conduct with that
growing feeling in favor of arbitration which it will become more
and more difficult to ignore. In every country the growth of law
and the extension of the jurisdiction of the courts which administered
it have been concurrent; the same rule must govern in the
field of international law.</p>

<p>There are vast fields at present untouched by the law of nations.
The discovery of the New World threw the jurists of that day into
bewilderment as to how rights in the American continents might
be acquired and established. A period of doubt and dispute ensued,
until finally Grotius, by applying certain rules of Roman
law regarding the acquirement of rights by individuals through
purchase, possession, etc., and by inventing certain other rules,
helped to supply a legal foundation upon which the acquisition of
these territories could be regulated. Looking toward the future,
one can see that, since there are no more continents to be discovered
and the habitable parts of the earth have been already taken
possession of by the colonial pioneer, the great principle of the survival
of the fittest must henceforth mainly work itself out in competitions
confined to the existing territories of the various powers.
This will necessitate the consideration of some deep questions concerning
the life and death of nations and the heirship to their
<span class="locked">dominions.<a name="FNanchor_U" id="FNanchor_U" href="#Footnote_U" class="fnanchor">U</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_U" id="Footnote_U" href="#FNanchor_U" class="fnanchor">U</a> <i>Vide</i> Contuzzi, Leggi di Composizioni e di Decomposizioni degli Stati.</p></div>

<p>It is widely believed, for instance, that China is dying a natural
death. Assuming it to be the fact, what will be the rules to govern
the inheritance of these Oriental domains? Great Britain,
Russia, Germany, the United States, and other nations have acquired
footholds and established interests within Chinese territory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Disputes will inevitably arise between them; many will be settled
by mutual compromise in which, perhaps, the chief consideration
will be the amount of warlike force behind the arguments advanced;
many others will be sure to find their way to an arbitral
tribunal, and before that body arguments will be made and by that
body decisions will be handed down embracing principles not now
to be found in the books, but which the circumstances of the case
and the demands of justice require. And so will doubtless ensue a
growth of “international judge-made law and equity” which will
gradually work an extension of the arbitral jurisdiction into fields
at present unknown to the law of nations. One thing is certain:
the law so developed must not, on the one hand, be in conflict with
the Grotian doctrine of the equality of states as rightly understood,
nor, on the other, with that great all-pervading law of the survival
of the fittest&mdash;a law which determines the destinies of men and
nations alike.</p>

<h2 title="The Fate of the Beagle" id="fate">THE FATE OF THE BEAGLE.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By the Rev. V. MARSHALL LAW.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">On</span> the 27th of December, 1831, his Majesty’s ship Beagle, a
ten-gun brig, under the command of Captain Fitz Roy, R.&nbsp;N.,
sailed from Devonport, England, on an expedition the purpose of
which was to complete a survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego
that had been begun under Captain King (1826&ndash;’30); to survey
the shores of Chile and Peru, and of some islands in the Pacific;
and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the
world. The voyage was one of the most memorable ones in the
annals of scientific exploration, for, besides the direct results, which,
in the condition of geography and natural history at the time, constituted
very important additions to knowledge, it carried Charles
Darwin, then young and full of the enthusiasm for study that
never left him. Mr. Darwin accompanied the expedition on the
invitation of its commander, Captain Fitz Roy, and with the special
sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty, and, as it turned out,
next to the captain of the vessel was perhaps the most important
member of it. He made it his special business to inquire into the
character and method and the reason of all the natural objects and
phenomena he saw, examining what was in the sea while they were
upon it, and, when they landed, going ashore and studying the
geography and geology and life of the region as thoroughly as the
time of stay would permit, and collecting no end of notes and specimens
as material for future study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_87" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S. Beagle in the Straits of Magellan. Mount Sarmiento in the Distance.</span></div></div>

<p>Besides his elaborate work giving the full story of the expedition
and the details of its scientific results&mdash;a book which has ever
since been a standard authority, and still keeps students in active
discussion and investigation&mdash;the voyage of the Beagle has to be
credited with having supplied the occasion for the composition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the briefer and more popular account which has become one of
the classics of English literature.</p>

<p>More than this, and vastly transcending it in the importance
of its bearing on the future of science, it was while going round
the world and observing on the Beagle that those fundamental
facts were gathered and stored in Mr. Darwin’s mind which, worked
over and developed in after years and compared and combined with
subsequently accumulated facts, bore fruit in the Origin of Species
and the transformation of science that resulted upon the enunciation
of Mr. Darwin’s theory of descent.</p>

<p>We all regard the association of any object with great events
or with those in which we have great interest as making it precious.
We endow ships with a kind of personality, regard them
affectionately, and often speak of them fondly, as if they were real
living beings in whom we had an interest. Such feelings we might
legitimately entertain with regard to the Beagle, so closely associated
with the history we have referred to. Few associations
deserve, in fact, to be more highly valued than that of this brig,
the Beagle, with Mr. Darwin’s books and his theory. It is therefore
a matter of legitimate concern to inquire into what was the
fate of the famous vessel.</p>

<p>The inquiry has been made, and is answered by the Rev. V.
Marshall Law, of Oakland, Cal., whose account follows:</p>

<p>“I was lying in my room, in Tsukiji, as I had been day after day,
in 1890, watching the lazy roll of the school-ship in the Imperial
Naval Academy, just a little to the south, when a caller and an
old resident, Mr. Arthur Morris, said to me, ‘I see you have Darwin’s
old ship, the Beagle, in plain sight out there.’</p>

<p>“‘Is that the Beagle?’ I asked in great surprise.</p>

<p>“He assured me that it was, and somehow after he had gone it
impressed itself more strongly on my mind the more I thought
of it. I lay ill, and part of the time in delirium, for ten days.
When I at last got up, the Beagle was gone. I sent inquiries
to the Naval Academy, but no one seemed to know anything
about her. As soon as I was able to go out, I lost no time in
setting on foot inquiries of the whereabouts of the missing ship.
I finally learned that she had probably gone to the Imperial Navy
Yard in Yokosuka, about thirty miles from Tokio. As soon as I
was able to travel we started to go to Yokosuka in search of the
missing vessel. Before this, however, I had taken the precaution
to put on the track the Englishman, Mr. F.&nbsp;W. Hammond, who
taught the young Japanese gunnery in the Imperial Naval Academy
at Tokio, and he promised to do all in his power&mdash;which in
this instance was very great&mdash;to help me in my search for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Beagle. To aid him, I gave him the following list of questions,
to which he sent me the answers given below months afterward.
My questions had gone through the regular naval channels. The
answers show how methodical the Japanese are, even if they are
slow. In these answers I use their language:</p>

<p>“‘Question. How did the Japanese Government happen to get
the Beagle?’</p>

<p>“‘Answer. The details of getting are not plainly known, but the
Prince of Kagoshima procured it on seventy-five thousand dollars,
at the 23d of July, first year of Genzi (1860), afterward he offered
it to the Government at the June of the third year of Genzi.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. Are there any good photographs of her as she was when
a war ship?’</p>

<p>“‘A. No, we have no one.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. Where is the Beagle now?’</p>

<p>“‘A. After out of use, she was applied as a Chastising Place for
seamen at the Yokosuka station, and then was auctioned at the
March, twenty-second year of Genzi.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. What was the date of her arrival in Japan?’</p>

<p>“‘A. She was received by the Prince of Kagoshima, at Nagasaki,
July, the first year of Genzi.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. What is her present name? When was her name
changed?’</p>

<p>“‘A. At the present this ship has no name in the consequence
of out of use, but after procured by the Kagoshima Prince the name
of Beagle was changed into Kenko Kan.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. Do you know how old this ship is, and what she was used
for by the British Government before the Japanese got her?’</p>

<p>“‘A. She was actually used during twenty-three years, after
which she was put out of use, having been constructed at Liverpool,
and we can not know what she was applied for before got
by Japan, but she remained more or less than one year in England.’
(Darwin made his famous voyage in her from 1831 to
1836.)</p>

<p>“‘Q. What is the name of the captain who had charge of her
after she became the property of the Japanese Government?’</p>

<p>“‘A. Commander Sadakumi Shiba was appointed the acting
captain February, 2d year of Genzi; Commander S. Hamataki, from
December, 5th year of Genzi; Commander M. Omura, from November,
10th year of Genzi; Commander Sadakumi Shiba, from
December, 11th year of Genzi; then the last was dismissed on
the September, in the 14th year of Genzi.’</p>

<p>“‘Q. In what capacity did the Japanese Government use her
from the time she arrived up to the time she was dismantled?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
“‘A. She was rated as the fifth class at the November, 4th
year of Genzi, then the fourth class May the 8th year.’</p>

<p>“We found Yokosuka, and our party were shown every courtesy
by the Japanese naval officials; so at last we ran down the
Beagle, lying on the shore and showing not a vestige of her proud,
historic self. She was being torn to pieces, and the parts were
sold for ‘old junk.’</p>

<p>“I reflected, as I stood among her spars and chains, her anchors
and her capstan, of the significance of the career of the famous
vessel, and of her associations with the man whose investigations
revolutionized scientific thought and spread consternation for a
time in the pulpits of the world. The attitude of these pulpits
has been modified by reason of those researches, and the blessings
of the world and of the Church now follow the author of them
for having shown the way to a juster and more rational conception
of the power and purposes of the Creator.”</p>

<h2 title="Science Study and National Character" id="science">SCIENCE STUDY AND NATIONAL CHARACTER.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By ALBERT B. CROWE.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Until</span> very recently it had come to be a commonly accepted
view in America that the civilization of a nation is directly
proportional to the amount it expends for education, and inversely
proportional to the amount it expends for war. The budgets of
European countries have given Americans good reason to accept
this standard, since its application gave the most gratifying evidence
of our great intellectual and moral advancement. Less than
three years ago the President of the National Educational Association
proudly exclaimed: “England, six to one for war; Russia,
thirty-eight to one for war; America, four to one for education!”</p>

<p>Since that time our country has become involved in war projects,
from which we can hardly hope it will withdraw, that have
increased our expenditure for war four times, and a policy has been
inaugurated which, if persisted in, will certainly almost at once
reverse our boasted ratio, making it “four to one for war”! This
course has been supported by a great body of our people. Even
our Christian ministers have committed “The White Man’s Burden”
to memory, and breathe never a whisper of the sixth commandment.
If, as has been held by all wise and good men, the
victories of peace are more worthy to be sung than those of war;
if the ability to avoid quarrels or to settle them without force of
arms is nobler than that which achieves military success; if true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
enlightenment and education make for peace and not for war, then
our law of direct and inverse proportion has lately been scandalously
dishonored.</p>

<p>If we have expended so much for education and at the same
time have lowered our ideal of national greatness, something must
be wrong with that education. If the sharpening and quickening
of the intellect are accompanied by a blunting and atrophy of the
moral sense, the best and the worst thing that can be said of our
school system is that it gives daily rations to hundreds of thousands
of teachers. Evidence of disease of the national conscience must
raise in the minds of thoughtful men grave doubts as to the sufficiency
of our education to “insure national progress, prosperity,
and honor,” whether because of inherent weakness of the system
or because of the strength of the forces opposed to it.</p>

<p>Has our system of education, then, failed to elevate our national
character? He who would answer this question in the affirmative
would be a pessimist indeed. Incalculable “general good”
has come to us, we think, by the agency of our schools. Without
them our civilization could not be so far advanced as it is; our
national life might have ended long since. In every crisis, however
black has been the storm, however fierce and ominous the
lightning flash, there has followed in good time the gentle rain,
soothing and allaying our fear, and giving renewed promise of prosperity
and peace. It is the sober second thought, we are in the
habit of saying, which saves us, which takes the helm and sheers
us away from the half-hidden reefs in our first mad course. It is
not. It is the sober first thought which has redeemed us from
destruction time after time&mdash;the sober first thought of the few
who are truly educated, who have looked below the surface of
things and considered the hidden and obscure results, who have
weighed the right and wrong and stood immovable for the right.
It is the counsel of such men which has fallen like the rain that
follows the first bursting of the storm, and has given us courage
and power to restrain ourselves and to face our hardest duty. For
such men in our national affairs we may reverently offer thanks,
and for an educational system which is partly, at least, responsible
for them we may have sincere praise. But our safety must always
depend upon the presence of such men, strong enough in numbers
and in influence to control each difficult and dangerous situation
which may threaten us. Our work as teachers is not faithful if
we do not increase this number and strengthen this influence.
And if such men have been overpowered in the important events
of the past two years, if they have been entirely ignored, or if
they have been taunted and ridiculed, we have reached a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
crisis, and our sacred duty is to stop and take our bearings. If
we have manifested certain national traits hitherto scarcely suspected,
and now unwillingly confessed, every motive of patriotism
and of prudence should impel us to study our case, that we may
effectively prescribe for it.</p>

<p>Are there not, then, certain signs which we may all agree are
discernible? Have not the waves of powerful feeling which have
swept over us, the storms of acrimonious debate which have raged
in our papers and forums, the pæans of praise which we have
chanted at our “peace jubilees” and hero parties, revealed the
prevalence and rapid growth of certain sentiments which we may
all, without regard to political belief, clearly recognize? I do not
in this place raise the question of the political wisdom or simple
justice of the course which the country has taken in its international
relations. I do not now challenge any belief as to these
matters which has been formed thoughtfully, honestly, manfully;
but I do maintain that the past few months have left lessons for
thoughtful, honest men to unite in studying.</p>

<p>Probably the most striking phenomenon which we have witnessed
has been the tremendous display of excited feeling. However
careful our national leaders may have been, however honest
in basing their actions on what they considered sufficient information,
or however careless and dishonest, no man who has read any
considerable number of our papers, who has listened to the clamor
of the crowds, can doubt that the force of blind passion has been
in hundreds of thousands of men the dominant force. If during
the war with Spain you stood in the cheering, surging crowds before
the bulletin boards, if you heard storms of hisses greet the
name of the innocent boy-King of Spain, or noted the cheer of
triumph which applauded the capture of a lumber scow by an
armored cruiser, you will have no difficulty in agreeing with
me. You will smile at the idea of imputing to such men the
credit of serious thought. On the birthday of the greatest American,
whose life was a message of liberty&mdash;“who,” said a great
Spanish orator, “laid down his life at the foot of his finished work”&mdash;our
papers printed jokes about the mistake of the Filipinos in
trying to fight Uncle Sam, and in our cities, at least, the report of
their slaughter was received with exultation. Whether they were
civilized or not, whether they were misled or not, whether they
were ignorant of America’s carefully concealed intention or not,
the killing of thousands of men who thought they were fighting
for their freedom, who faced machine guns, and who crawled away
into the bushes to die for the cause for which they had fought, is
hardly a subject for jokes or for exultation, when people are governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
by reason and not by feeling alone. When the Maine was
sunk in Havana Harbor her captain, in a notable dispatch telling
of the disaster, urged a suspension of judgment until the facts
should be known. Facts! In an hour our battle-cry was, “Remember
the Maine!” Under that motto, within a few days, one
of the great Chicago dailies (the Inter-Ocean) hung out the pennant
of the wrecked battle ship and enlistment signs. Who was
right&mdash;the Maine’s captain or the paper? Which appeal meant
safety, and which danger? Our own commission investigated the
wreck. After an examination, which was kept entirely within our
own hands, the commission reported that the ship had been destroyed
from the outside, but that there was no evidence to fix the
responsibility. Did we fix the responsibility? Though the investigation
board could find no evidence, though reason said that the
destroyer of the Maine, were he Spain’s own king, was Spain’s
worst enemy, we forgot the cause of deliverance, and went into
battle with the cry of vengeance on our lips. This is not a statement
of sentiment but of fact. Your motives, or the President’s,
or mine may have been pure&mdash;your opinion may have been unprejudiced&mdash;but
these things around us we all saw and all heard.
We know that many men were carried away by their feelings, and
did not think. We know that their feelings grew into a prejudice
which was absolutely certain to distort the facts and to drive them
far from the truth if they ever came to the point of thinking.
The ears of the multitude have been closed to all counsels, however
wise; their eyes to all consequences, however fatal; their minds
to all logic, however clear and simple.</p>

<p>We may consider more briefly, but not less carefully, other
tendencies which have been shown, seeing many of them in the
facts which have already been referred to.</p>

<p>From the fact that passion has so largely supplanted reason in
moving many of our people we have developed some wonderful
instances of credulity. The sequence is most natural. When men
become unwilling, or uncaring, to ascertain the truth for themselves
they inevitably display a great willingness to swallow any statement
which may obligingly be offered them by some one else. So,
with half of the Spanish navy sunk and the other half accounted
for, we spent hours of glorious, wild conjecture, in the dear dead
days beyond recall, listening to the awful sound of cannonading
in the Windward Passage, which reached us by the way of
Mole St. Nicholas. We believe what is sufficiently exciting to
be true.</p>

<p>Related to the phenomena we have noticed is another&mdash;the evident
loss of individuality&mdash;of moral and mental independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
How striking is it to compare some of our newspaper editorials of to-day
with those of two years ago in the same papers, and to see how
their writers have been dragged, step by step, into line with those
whom they formerly opposed! They have not changed their faith;
they have deserted it. For them there is the defense of business
necessity; but if you will to-day talk to many men who gave you
their opinions a few months ago, you will find that they have broken
down and given up&mdash;surrendered to superior numbers. In our
bulletin crowds we have all seen the spirit of the mob, which meets
the newcomer indifferent or doubtful, thrills him with the mysterious
influence of the men packed around and against him, and
sends him away an irresponsible monomaniac.</p>

<p>With such forces at work, it is inevitable that we should act,
or be ready to act, quickly. Why not? Reflection takes time.
To learn the facts fully and certainly takes time. To feel&mdash;how
long? To take another man’s word&mdash;how long? To give way to
a thousand other men&mdash;how long? We have all seen men cheering
our war with Spain only yesterday. To-day Austria seems
friendly to the queen regent. We’ll whip Austria, too. To-morrow
Germany is impudent to Dewey. We shall be ready by
night to whip Germany. If Europe combines against us, how long
shall we consider the cost of such a war as that? Write it on the
bulletin board&mdash;the crowd will be ready before the writing is done.</p>

<p>Near to this is the spirit of fickleness, of inconstancy, which
has been frequently manifested. We have not only made up our
minds on insufficient evidence, but we have unmade them in a
hurry on no evidence at all, showing a startling lack of confidence
in our own judgments and of respect for them. Attention might
well have been called, in a former paragraph, to the small amount
of our real knowledge of the character of Aguinaldo. On what
petty and inconsequential evidence have we first called him a great
liberator, and now a scheming politician! Men who could hardly
read his most remarkable appeal to this country do not hesitate to
call him an unprincipled, conceited, ignorant barbarian: what
reliable information have they received with reference to his motives?
They have found no trouble in changing their opinions.
In the past few months we have been mercurial almost beyond
mercurial Frenchmen. Think of the revulsion of feeling that followed
Hobson across the continent; and, more recently, of our
sad lack of self-restraint shown by the vicious and ungrounded
attack upon Admiral Dewey, only a few days after he had been the
object of the greatest display of hero worship America has ever
seen. And how many important changes may we count, if we
carry back our comparison to the time before the war?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
But by so doing we uncover another significant fact. We find
that many of the ideas so quickly thrown aside are those which
have been the foundation principles, and bear the prestige of great
names. We have held it our special mission to show to warlike
nations that a power which stands for peace may be greater than
theirs; and, alas! many of our leaders, and our people, too, are
crying that the time has come&mdash;has <i>now</i> come&mdash;for us to take our
place among the great nations of the earth. We have pitied the
war-taxed peoples of Europe, and offered them a home where they
would not have to buy powder and guns. And now we are eagerly
rushing to take up the burden from which they have been fleeing
to us. We have held that great standing armies are unnecessary
and dangerous, and already we have quadrupled ours. We have
declared our determination to avoid foreign entanglements, and
now we are in the very heart of the sputtering coil in the far East.
With those who have thoughtfully decided that these changes have
been necessary or wise I have no wish to debate now, but we must
all unite in recognizing the spirit which has been shown, and is
now shown, in speaking of our past positions. The principles which
for years have been our rules of national conduct have been thrown
aside in a day, scoffed at, mocked. And we smile at the names of
the great men who have announced those principles and defended
them, or we flatly declare they are out of date. We once listened
with reverent and full hearts when our wise men spoke to us of
freedom, and recalled our national traditions and taught national
righteousness. Now we laugh at swaddling clothes outgrown, outused,
and smile at the innocent simplicity of our fathers. We lift
our brows at the name of Washington: we say he was a fine old gentleman,
and his Farewell Address, considering everything, was a
very creditable paper, and well adapted to the exigencies of the time
in which it was written. And this carnival of irreverence is holding
not only in our streets, but in our newspaper offices, in our pulpits,
and in some of our higher institutions of learning.</p>

<p>These are the phenomena of our recent national experience
which I desire you to consider. There may be other unfavorable
indications. There may be others, and many more, which are
hopeful and encouraging. But these clearly warn us of danger.
Furthermore, I insist that whatever may have been your sympathy
with the Administration, or your opposition to it; however numerous
the men of your acquaintance who have been free from such
influences, you must have seen them at work in a dangerously large
part of our population. Even if that part has, in your judgment,
reached the right position, you must recognize the ominous character
of their method of reaching it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Now, what has this to do with us? What connection has it
with our work? If science teaching has any educational value, the
most definite and direct connection. I shall not do you the injustice
of supposing that any tendency I have named did not at once
bear to you its proper suggestion. If it has failed, the fault has
been in the presentation of a very simple matter. For every perilous
tendency I have mentioned has its life in direct violation of the
essential principles of science study, and may be restrained by
extending the knowledge and habitual use of those principles.</p>

<p>I do not wish to claim for science work an unwarranted value
in this respect, nor to deny the influence of other subjects in bringing
about a moral evolution. It is true that history warns us by
examples, that it points us to the failure of free governments in
whose steps to destruction many of us seem only too willing to
follow. It is true that we can learn from Rome the results of imperialism;
from France, of irreverence; from Spain, of tyranny. In
other fields of learning we may find other lessons of present value.
But to meet the dangers that just now assail us, the national weaknesses
that I have enumerated, the scientific studies seem especially
fitted.</p>

<p>“The great peculiarity of scientific training,” says Huxley,
“that in virtue of which it can not be replaced by any other discipline
whatsoever, is the bringing of the mind directly into contact
with fact, and practicing the intellect in the completest form
of induction&mdash;that is to say, in drawing conclusions from particular
facts made known by immediate observation of Nature.” “The
bringing of the mind into contact with fact.” This means the
recognition of the existence of incontrovertible truth. The dawning
knowledge of such truth must bring with it the consciousness
that much that we have always accepted as truth is open to question.
Thus every belief, no matter what its nature, is in time subjected
to examination. If it stand, it stands because it is able to
bear this searching scrutiny and to answer fairly the questions of
honest doubt. Honest doubt may be the result of honest reasoning;
it must absolutely demand honest reasoning to satisfy it.
This exercise of the rational faculty, then, depends upon and results
from an awakened love of truth. How directly do these
most obvious principles of scientific investigation bear upon the
facts we have been considering! How flatly do they forbid us to
be carried away into excesses! Let us apply them briefly, point
by point.</p>

<p>If love of truth and appeal to reason mean anything at all, they
mean, first of all, eternal opposition to the power of unthinking
passion&mdash;of blind feeling. They mean that every sentiment should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
have a rational cause and a reasonable object. They do not forbid
feeling, but they require thinking.</p>

<p>Secondly, they defy prejudice. They call for the open court,
the fair trial, the impartial judge. They say “No” to worthless
witnesses and to packed juries.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they demand a sufficient amount of evidence. True
science is the enemy of wildcat theories and reckless generalizations.
“The United States has always come out on top in every
war!” cries one. “There’s no danger that we’ll ever be whipped.”
“I don’t like foreigners,” says another. “I had a Frenchman
for a neighbor once, and he was dishonest. I’m in favor of shutting
out foreigners.” Such reasoning as this&mdash;and how astoundingly
common it is!&mdash;must be cut down at the root by the habit of
trained induction.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the love of truth and appeal to reason, which are in
the very grain of the scientific mind and heart, laugh at credulity.
They do not scoff at authority, or reject it. But they say: “We
must know. If we learn from you, we must know that you
know. Who are you? How do you know? If you know, you
will not offer us absurd contradictions of reason and accepted
truth.”</p>

<p>Again, they make their abode with the man who can receive
them at his own intellectual fireside. They require that his mind
be his own, that his opinions be his own, that his acts be his own,
and that he defend his property in them, have pride in them, and
stand by them.</p>

<p>Again, they demand sufficient time for care, for securing the
evidence and for weighing it, and for considering its effect. They
demand the completed work, and they reject all results which do
not come from time employed, but are hasty guesses.</p>

<p>And they are not tossed about like a wave of the sea. They
do command to prove all things, but they also exhort to hold fast
that which is good. First, to what is good of our own and in ourselves.
It is well enough to throw away our guesses, quickly made
and often wrong. But the fruit of honest investigation, the conclusions
of careful reasoning on sufficient information, these are
the science student’s riches. He may add to them or replace some
of them by better, but he will not throw them away at a suggestion,
or trade them to the first speculator who offers something else.
He will not have a supply of new beliefs for every day, or for every
month, or for every year. Second, we should hold fast the proved
good which we have received from others. And we should honor
and revere those who have opened the way for us to the truth&mdash;those
who have above other men possessed the power of reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and beneficently used it for the world. The spirit of science, which
sets infinite value on knowledge, can not fail to teach reverence
for those who have made it possible for us to know.</p>

<p>At every point, then, the scientist opposes the tendencies I have
deplored. Against them all he must stand, by training and by
instinct. Against them all he would teach others to stand, by giving
to them his own training. Against them all we science teachers
may arm our countrymen if we are faithful to our duty. But
this end of our work is defeated if our students are allowed to
indulge in careless statements of what they see and do; if they are
permitted to use exaggerated description or inaccurate terms.
Right here is the crucial test of the teacher’s honesty of purpose.
The careful examination of written descriptions and reports, the enforced
correction of every inaccurate detail, the personal consultation&mdash;all
require untiring labor, and time never allotted in the
schedule. But such work carried out has its own reward. The
student first respects the truth, then learns to love it. He conscientiously
avoids the vague, the doubtful, the unsubstantiated.
If in our schools we might insure to every boy and girl this attitude
of mind, this desire for strict veracity, we should have started
him well on the way to correct judgments and wise conduct; we
should have implanted in his nature the first elements of good citizenship.

<p>The fish called Lepidosiren (<i>Lepidosiren paradoxica</i>) is one of the only
three still existing survivors of the once prominent group of <i>Dipnoi</i>,
or lung fishes, which are characterized by the possession of well-developed
lungs in addition to their gills. Mr. Graham Kerr, who spent several
months in the swamps of the Gran Chaco, South America, a habitat of
these fishes, describes them as living among the dense vegetation of the
swamp, swimming in eel fashion, or clambering through the mass of
vegetation by means of their leglike limbs. In the dry season they retire
into the mud, and breathe entirely by means of their lungs. When the
wet season begins they are set free, and at once prepare to spawn. They
lay their eggs in burrows at the bottom of the swamp, where the eggs
develop into larvæ. The phenomena of their development are of special
interest, because it takes place in seclusion, away from the disturbing
features due to adaptation to varied surroundings. It has been discovered
that the young lepidosirens become white and transparent during
the hours of darkness.</p>

<h2 title="Editor’s Table" id="editors">Editor’s Table.</h2>

<h3><i>THOUGHTS FOR THE TIMES.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Good</span> use was made of a Washington
celebration at Oberlin
College, Ohio, by the chief speaker
of the occasion, the Rev. A.&nbsp;A.
Berle, to utter words that are peculiarly
needed at the present time.
His subject was Popular American
Fallacies, and among these he noted
the following: That Anglo-Saxondom
is identical with the kingdom
of God; that national glory and
power can supply the place of national
character; that new occasions
always teach <i>new</i> duties; and that
political alliances may do away with
the necessity for “a dual alliance,”
as he expressed it, “between the
people and God.”</p>

<p>These particular fallacies, in
our opinion, were happily chosen.
There is a great deal of silly talk
current about the incomparable glories
and unimaginable destinies of
the Anglo-Saxon race; and it never
seems to occur to those who indulge
in such talk that a profound sense
of one’s greatness is very far from
being a sure sign of greatness. The
greatest characters are the simplest
and least boastful. Their greatness
is so native to them that they are
scarcely conscious of it; and they
leave it to others to sing their
praises. It is presuming altogether
too intimate an acquaintance with
the designs of Providence to claim
that any race in particular is
charged, above all others, with carrying
those designs into effect.
Who knows what reservoirs of
moral and intellectual force may reside
in nations and tribes whose
world-action has been very obscure
as yet? Dr. Arnold, of Rugby,
thought that much of high value
for civilization lay dormant in the
negro race, and it is too soon to
say he was mistaken. Then, who
knows what the Slavonic race may
bring forth? Who can calculate the
future of the vast human hive
known as China? And, after all,
what has any nation got to do except
to behave itself, be it great or small,
famous or of no great repute? How
is it in the community? Do we admire
great men who swagger, who
boast of their wealth, their strength,
their courage, or their virtue? A
little quiet consideration will persuade
any man that there is one law
for all nations alike&mdash;the law of justice
and humanity&mdash;and that the
greatest nation, according to any
true conception of greatness, is the
one which exemplifies that law most
perfectly in its domestic and foreign
policy. The surest sign of
greatness in a nation, we venture to
say, is that it should hate war&mdash;not
dread it, but hate it.</p>

<p>It is a singular thing that any
but the most light-headed portion
of the community should fall into
the second fallacy which the speaker
mentioned&mdash;that national glory and
power can take the place of national
character. A nation requires a true
heart, an honest self-consciousness,
just as much as an individual, and
time will avenge national misdoings
just as surely as it will those
of individuals. No numbers, nor any
amount of huzzaing or factitious
enthusiasm, can make a vicious policy
safe. You may win victories
with chariots and horsemen, but to
enjoy the fruits of peace there must
be a dominant love of justice, and
that is what war does not tend to
promote. It is also very true, as
the speaker said, that there are not
many <i>new</i> duties to be learned in
this age of the world. There is
enough of moral truth taught in old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Hesiod’s Works and Days to make
any society now existing a good
deal better than it is. When people
talk of new duties they generally
mean some new harum-scarum enterprise.
The old duty would be
good enough if they would only consider
it closely and follow it faithfully.
The Rev. Mr. Berle has spoken
words in season; and it would
be well if all who are like minded
would unceasingly proclaim the
same doctrines, if perchance they
may sink into the heart of the
masses, and give to this great people
a public policy founded on righteousness
and the love of peace.</p>

<h3><i>A HUMILIATING SITUATION.</i></h3>

<p>“How far, O Catiline, when all
is said and done, are you going to
abuse our patience?” So said the
great Roman orator on a certain
famous occasion. Our Catiline is
no individual man; it is the party
system which has inflicted on us
the Puerto Rican disgrace. It was
obvious to the common sense of
every one that, having laid our
hands on the island of Puerto Rico,
there was no decent course to take
save to make it, for all practical
purposes, an integral portion of the
Union. We had cut it off from the
market it enjoyed in Spain, and left
it to contend with the hostile tariffs
of other countries&mdash;were we going,
in addition to that, to make it a
stranger to the land that had seized
it, and subject its products to our
own high scale of duties? The
President, in his message to Congress,
conceiving the proposition to
be almost self-evident, had declared
that it was “our plain duty to abolish
all customs tariffs between the
United States and Puerto Rico, and
give her products free access to our
markets.” So thought nearly every
disinterested citizen, and yet what
have we since seen? The President,
terrorized by the cry of party unity
in danger, repudiates his former
emphatic declaration, and gives his
approval to a measure which virtually
makes our unfortunate possession
a foreign country. With the
“free access to our markets” which
the President had promised, the
island would have entered on a new
career of prosperity; but with its
leading industries weighed down
under an impost of fifteen per cent,
there is nothing in view but commercial
stagnation and general poverty.
That the island has already
languished under American rule&mdash;our
revolutionary forefathers did
not expect that their descendants
would so soon go into the “ruling”
business&mdash;the most disinterested
witnesses attest. A leading journal
of this city, The Herald, prints
in heavy-faced type the following
statement of a correspondent:</p>

<p>“American military officials told
me at the outset that the year and a
half of American sovereignty had
been a blight on the island. This
was not the echo of Spanish or of
Puerto Rican feelings. They spoke
their own views with soldierly frankness
and sometimes with a word of
regret for their own position. Their
talk was more pointed than when
filtered through official channels.”</p>

<p>It is in these circumstances that
our Legislature, at the instance of
a benevolent President, decides to
refund to the people of the island
two million dollars of duties collected
in our ports on their products.
Our tariff system breeds poverty
in the population it oppresses,
and then we rush to their assistance
with a largess. They ask for justice
and we offer them alms&mdash;alms for
which the correspondent already
quoted says he can not find a single
individual who is grateful. We rob
the Puerto Rican Peter to pay our
own tobacco-growing Paul; and then
we rob the whole community in order
to pay back Peter. And, strange
to say, some of us feel very virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
over the business. The countenance
of the President glows with
satisfaction over the thought of all
the good he is doing. For our part,
we view the matter in a different
light. The money will, of course,
meet certain expenses of government
in Puerto Rico; but there is
reason to fear that it will do as
much to pauperize the island in one
direction as the restriction of its
trade will do in another. What the
Puerto Ricans want is not alms, but
commercial liberty. The repayment
of this money will not stimulate
their trade; it will not stimulate
anything except their helplessness.
It is an open question whether
they will suffer more by our protectionist
greed or by our wishy-washy
sentimentality. Meantime
what are we to think of the party
system whose exigencies place us in
so ridiculous a position before the
world? How long shall it abuse our
patience?</p>

<p><b>Ventilation of Tunnels.</b>&mdash;The question
of the ventilation of tunnels forms
the subject of a series of articles, by
M. Raymond Godfernaux, published recently
in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Génie Civil</i>. The principal
sources of definite information, upon
which the discussion of M. Godfernaux
is based, are the reports of the committee
on ventilation of tunnels of the
Metropolitan Railway of London, and
of the commission appointed by the
Italian Minister of Public Works to investigate
the tunnels of the railways of
the department of the Adriatic. Although
the vitiation of the air in a tunnel
may proceed from three sources&mdash;i. e.,
the lighting, the respiration of the
passengers, and the combustion of the
fuel in the engines&mdash;yet the two former
sources are insignificant compared with
the latter, which alone need be considered.
The principal products of combustion
which are injurious are carbonic
acid, carbonic oxide, and sulphurous
acid. Of these it is found that the proportion
of carbonic oxide should not
exceed 0.01 per cent, which corresponds
to 0.13 per cent of carbonic acid in
excess of the normal proportion of 0.03
per cent and to 0.00027 per cent of sulphurous
acid. In practice it is found
that if the total proportion of carbonic
acid be limited to 0.15 per cent the proportions
of the other gases will be well
within the comfort and danger limits.
This is much lower than is often attained
in crowded auditoriums, where
the proportion of carbonic acid sometimes
reaches 0.4 to 0.5 per cent, but in
such cases there is no carbonic oxide
produced, while in the case of tunnels
traversed by steam locomotives we may
assume that the carbonic oxide will be
about 1 to 13 of the carbonic acid, and
the sulphurous acid about 1 to 440. Assuming
a given limit of deterioration of
the air, it would be easy to devise a
system of ventilation if it were possible
to treat the tunnel as if it were a closed
room or controllable space. In practice,
however, the conditions are peculiar.
The space to be ventilated is a
long, narrow passage, usually open only
at the ends, and traversed periodically
often almost continuously, by trains in
one or both directions, these trains emitting
the objectionable gases and also
disturbing the air currents best adapted
to proper ventilation. How best to reconcile
these conflicting conditions forms
the problem under consideration. Where
there are but few trains it has been
proposed to close the ends of the tunnel
by doors, and provide a fan exhaust or
pressure system, but this method is
obviously limited in its applications.
The practical conditions which must
be considered are those in which frequent
trains in opposite directions pass
through the tunnel, and these conditions
M. Godfernaux has analyzed
graphically in a very interesting manner.
Assuming a double-track tunnel
eight hundred metres (a metre contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
39.37 inches) in length, with an exhausting
ventilator placed in the middle
and with trains of a given gas-producing
capacity passing on each track every
three minutes, he constructs a diagram
showing how the composition of the atmosphere
of the tunnel varies at successive
points, and how, by an examination
of the diagram thus made, it is
possible to discover the maximum vitiation
of the air, and consequently the
extent to which the conditions are satisfied.
By one or two such constructions
any such problem may be solved to a
degree quite within the limits of practical
work, and the effect of various
systems of ventilation compared. M.
Godfernaux discusses various systems of
ventilation, including those involving
the use of shafts, fan blowers and exhausters,
and air jets, and concludes
with a description of the Saccardo system,
in use in the Apennine tunnel of
the Bologna-Pistoia line, and to the St.
Gothard Tunnel. While all this investigation
and discussion is of much value,
it certainly seems as if the true remedy
lies not so much in the removal of deleterious
gases as in the absence of their
production. The substitution of electric
traction avoids altogether the fouling of
the air of tunnels and subways, and
electric locomotives are already used in
the Baltimore Tunnel in the United
States and elsewhere, and it seems as if
this remedy is the true one to be applied
in all cases.</p>

<p><b>Liquid Air.</b>&mdash;The following warning
appears in The Engineering and
Mining Journal of March 3d: “The advertisements
which are now appearing
in the papers all over the country of
companies which are to furnish liquid
air on a large scale must be accepted
with a great deal of caution. The public
mind has been very adroitly worked
up for the reception of these by lectures,
paragraphs in the press, and other
well-understood methods. Undoubtedly
liquid air possesses some valuable properties,
and many striking experiments
can be performed with it. It is not by
any means certain yet that it can be
prepared, transported, and used economically
on a commercial scale, or that the
difficulties in the way have been overcome.
We do not say that they may
not be overcome in the future; but to
talk, as the advertisements do, of the
certainty that liquid air will soon largely
replace steam in furnishing motive
power is going entirely too far. Such
assertions have no present basis of fact
to warrant any one in making them.
The liquid-air people have a great deal
to do yet before they can establish their
claims or carry on business on a scale
that will warrant the organization of
ten-million-dollar companies. The question
of validity of patents is also quite
an open one. It is doubtful if there is
any valid patent on this subject.”</p>

<p><b>Taka-Diastase.</b>&mdash;The following is
taken from an interesting article, by W.
E. Stone and H.&nbsp;E. Wright, in The Journal
of the American Chemical Society:
“Taka-diastase is, so far as known,
somewhat similar to malt-diastase in its
chemical character, viz.: a highly nitrogenous
substance, readily soluble in
water, and dependent upon certain conditions
of temperature for its maximum
activity. Its action is also affected by
alkalies and acids. It is produced as the
result of the growth of a species of
mold (<i>Eurotium oryzæ</i>, Ahlberg) upon
rice, maize, wheat bran, etc. For its
production, as at present practiced in
this country, wheat bran is steamed
and, after cooling, is sown with the
spores of the fungus. After twenty-four
hours in culture rooms, at a temperature
of about 25° C., the fungous growth
becomes visible. In forty or fifty hours
the content in diastatic material has
reached the maximum, and further
growth of the fungus is checked by cooling.
The material, now consisting of
the bran felted together with fungus
mycelium, is called ‘taka-koji.’ It
may be mixed with grain or starchy
materials in the same manner as malt
is used, and, like malt, will speedily
convert the starch into fermentable
sugars. An aqueous extract of the mass
may be used for a similar purpose. For
the preparation of a pure product,
which, however, is not necessary for ordinary
industrial purposes, the aqueous
extract is concentrated by evaporation,
and on the addition of alcohol the diastatic
substance may be precipitated as
a yellowish powder, easily soluble in
water, of stable keeping qualities, and
possessed of an unusual power of converting
starch into sugar. The medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
preparation above mentioned is obtained
in this way, and represents a
fairly pure form of the diastatic principle.
This bears the name of ‘taka-diastase.’”</p>

<p><b>Professor Agassiz’s Investigations
on Coral Islands.</b>&mdash;Having
steamed and observed for twenty-five
hundred miles among the Paumotu Islands,
Prof. Alexander Agassiz says, in
a second letter from the Albatross Expedition,
published in the American
Journal of Science, that he has seen
nothing tending to show that there has
anywhere been a subsidence, but that
the condition of the islands does not
seem to him capable of explanation on
any theory except that they have been
formed in an area of elevation. All the
islands examined are composed of a tertiary
coralliferous limestone, which has
been elevated to a greater or less extent
above the level of the sea, and then
planed down by atmospheric agencies
and submarine erosion, and the appearance
of this old rock is very different
from that of the modern reef rock. In
these islands the rims of the great
atolls, after having been denuded to the
level of the sea, are built up again from
the material of their two faces, so that
a kind of conglomerate, or breccia, or
pudding stone, or beach rock is found on
all the reef flats. On the lagoon side
sand bars grow into small islands and
gradually become covered with vegetation.
Whenever the material supplied
from both sides is very abundant the
land ring becomes more or less solid;
the islets become islands, separated by
narrow or wider cuts, until they at
length form the large islands, which
seem at first to be a continuous land
around the rim of the lagoon, while
they are often really much dissected. In
time water ceases to pass through the
channels, and only the marks of them
are left. Few if any of the lagoons appear
to be shut off from the sea as Dana
and other writers have supposed. They
simply have not boat passages. Unlike
other coral regions, the Paumotu reefs
seem to bear only a scanty life.</p>

<p><b>“Winking.”</b>&mdash;No satisfactory determination
has been made of the reason
we wink. Some suppose that the descent
and return of the lid over the eye
serves to sweep or wash it off; others
that covering of the eye gives it a rest
from the labor of vision, if only for an
inappreciable instant. This view borrows
some force from the fact that the
record of winking is considerably used
by experimental physiologists to help
measure the fatigue which the eye suffers.
In another line of investigation
Herr S. Garten has attempted to measure
the length of time occupied by the
different phases of a wink. He used a
specially arranged photographic apparatus,
and affixed a piece of white paper
to the edge of the eyelid for a mark.
He found that the lid descends quickly,
and rests a little at the bottom of its
movement, after which it rises, but
more slowly than it fell. The mean duration
of the downward movement was
from seventy-five to ninety-one thousandths
of a second; the rest with the
eye shut lasted variously, the shortest
durations being fifteen hundredths of a
second with one subject and seventeen
hundredths with another; and the third
phase of the wink, the rising of the lid,
took seventeen hundredths of a second
more, making the entire duration of the
wink about forty hundredths, or four
tenths of a second. The interruption is
not long enough to interfere with distinct
vision. M.V. Henri says, in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L’Année
Psychologique</i>, that different persons
wink differently&mdash;some often, others
rarely; some in groups of ten or so at
a time, when they rest a while; and
others regularly, once only at a time.
The movement is modified by the degree
of attention. Periods of close interest,
when we wink hardly at all, may be followed
by a speedy making up for lost
time by rapid winking when the tension
is relieved.</p>

<p><b>An Ingenious Method of Locating
an Obstruction.</b>&mdash;The Engineering
Record gives the following interesting
account of the scientific solving of
a practical commercial problem: “The
pneumatic dispatch tube for the delivery
of mail between the main Philadelphia
post office and a branch office at
Chestnut and Third Streets is a cast-iron
pipe buried below the surface of
the street, and in it small cylindrical
carriers, six inches in diameter, are propelled
from end to end by air pressure.
At one time a carrier became lodged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
some unknown point in the tube, and to
remove the obstruction it was desirable
to locate its position as closely as possible
before digging down to the pipe.
This was satisfactorily accomplished by
firing a pistol at one end of the tube;
its report was echoed from the obstruction,
and indicated its position by the
time required for the transmission of
the sound. The pistol was fired in a
hole in the side of the pneumatic tube
near the end, which was capped and
had a rubber-hose connection to the recording
apparatus. The end of the rubber
hose terminated in a chamber closed
by a diaphragm about five inches in
diameter, which had a stylus attached
to it. A cock in the middle of the rubber
hose was partly closed to reduce the
force of the explosion on the diaphragm,
and the pistol was fired. The sound-wave
immediately produced a movement
of the diaphragm, causing the stylus
to make a mark on the record diagram.
The hose cock was then fully
opened, and when the sound-wave had
traveled to the obstruction and been reflected
back it again moved the diaphragm,
and caused the stylus to make
a second mark on the diagram. The
lapse of time had been automatically
recorded on the same diagram, so to
determine the distance it was only
necessary to note the exact interval of
time between the direct and reflected reports,
divide it by two, and multiply the
quotient by the velocity of sound under
the existing conditions.” The obstruction
was indicated at 1,537 feet from
the diaphragm. Excavations were made
at this place, and the carrier was found
nearly at the calculated point. The
limits of distance at which this method
is applicable have not yet been determined,
but Mr. Batcheller, the engineer
of the Pneumatic Tube Company and
the deviser of the above ingenious expedient,
has found that in a tube 43.3
inches in diameter a pistol shot will
vibrate a sensitive diaphragm at a distance
of 65,129 feet; decreasing the diameter
of the tube decreases the distance
over which the pistol shot will act.</p>

<p><b>Diseased Meat in Paris.</b>&mdash;The police
of Paris, says the Lancet, have just
laid hands on a vast fraudulent organization
for evading the precautionary
measures drawn up by the authorities
for inspecting the meat distributed for
consumption in the suburbs of Paris.
Both for Paris and the suburbs all animals
destined for food have to be killed
in public slaughterhouses, where the
strictest watch is kept by the municipal
veterinary surgeons, who forbid the delivery
to the butchers of any meat
which exhibits the slightest suspicious
signs. Elaborate regulations have been
laid down as to the various diseases
which render meat unfit for the food of
man, and naturally enough tuberculosis
is the complaint most rigorously watched
for. The swindlers who have been arrested
made up a vast organization
which used to buy up from the farms of
the eastern provinces and even in Germany
such animals as, owing to disease,
would have been refused for slaughter
at the abattoirs, and, moreover, they
bought them dirt cheap. These animals
were then conveyed in regular herds to
a small place near Paris and killed in
sheds built at the bottom of an old
quarry. Under cover of night the meat
was taken away by the accomplice
butchers and resold in the various suburban
shops. In connection with this
clandestine slaughterhouse the firm had
a kind of cemetery, where those animals
were buried the meat of which was too
bad for even the swindlers to risk its sale
in the market. Ivry was the place where
the fraud was discovered, and the official
inquiry shows that the organization
was singularly complete. It is extraordinary
that the slaughterhouse,
which was in full work, should never
have attracted the attention of the villagers,
but it must be remembered that
all killing was done by night and that
the slaughtermen were all Germans who
did not understand a word of French,
and were therefore unable to engage in
imprudent conversation with the neighbors.</p>

<p><b>How Aluminum is made.</b>&mdash;In a
paper read before the Manchester Junior
Electrical Engineers, J.&nbsp;H. Henderson
describes the two commercial methods
of making aluminum: The agent which
has made aluminum a commercial product
is electricity. This is how electrolysis
produces it (by one successful method):
In a metal, carbon-lined crucible
having two carbon electrodes, one of
which acts as anode and the other as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
cathode, are put the following ingredients:
Fluoride of calcium, 234 parts
by weight; double fluoride of cryolite,
421 parts by weight; fluoride of aluminum,
845 parts by weight. To these
add three to four per cent of a suitable
chloride&mdash;for example, calcium chloride.
To this add alumina sufficient to form a
very stiff mixture. Before electrolysis
can begin the above are fused by means
of heat, which should not exceed 1,210°
F. The heat is obtained from a furnace
heated by gas, coke, or charcoal, care
being taken that no gases from the furnace
enter the crucible. The bath fused,
the electrodes are dipped into it, the current
switched on, and the metal is deposited
(in the best and largest of these
crucibles) at the rate of one pound per
five electrical horse-power hours. The
current pressure required is six to eight
volts, at a density of one and a half ampères
per square inch. The metal from
time to time is removed from the crucible
by means of a siphon or a ladle,
care being taken to remove as little of
the haloid salts as possible. There is another
method of extraction equally successful
with this, but also more economical.
In this other method a set of similar
ingredients are placed in a crucible
having one or more vertically movable
carbon electrodes, which are used as one,
or a collective anode, respectively. The
crucible, though lined principally with
carbon, has some metal exposed to act as
a cathode at the beginning of the process,
this to generate heat enough to fuse the
bath, after which the anode is placed so
that the extracted aluminum acts as a
cathode. The molten metal is from
time to time run out of a tap-hole into
a mold, and thence cast into ingots, or
granulated by being poured into cold
water. The same particulars as to results
apply to this crucible furnace
process also, only that not nearly so
much of the bath is wasted in it, and
the metal needs less purifying when
molten. There are, also, no loss of time
and money from the use of gas, coke, or
charcoal, and of an extra furnace in
this method.</p>

<p><b>“A Mechanical Bootblack.”</b>&mdash;A
bootblacking apparatus is one of the
latest developments of the nickel-in-the-slot
machine, a specimen of which is
undergoing trial in a French public garden.
The customer drops his coin&mdash;in
the present case a ten centime, or a two-and-a-half-cent
piece&mdash;into the receptacle,
which opens the way to a compartment
where a brush cleans his boots;
he next puts his feet into a second compartment
and has them blackened; and
then into a third, where they are polished.
The operation takes about a
minute and a half, and during the time
the customer may watch the indications
of its progress as they are shown upon
the dial. The machinery working in
the inside is very simple. An electric
motor of small power&mdash;about eighteen
kilogrammetres per second&mdash;controls
the shaft on which the three rotary
brushes are fixed, and the customer has
only to unlock the machine, the same
as all others of its kind, with his coin,
and move the handle which opens the
circuit and starts the motion. A representation
of the machine at work is

<p><b>The “Barisal Guns.”</b>&mdash;A curious
phenomenon of unexplained sounds like
those of explosions, occasionally heard
in different places over the earth, has
attracted much attention, has been
made the subject of a book recording
several hundred accounts of it, by M.
Ernest Van den Broeck, of Brussels, and
has already been mentioned in the Popular
Science Monthly. The phenomenon
has been most carefully observed in
India, where it seems to have assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
a peculiarly marked form, and is known
there as the “Barisal guns.” M. Van
den Broeck calls it “mistpoeffers,” or
air-puffs. The most definite description
of it is given in Nature by Mr.
Henry S. Schurr, as he has heard it
in India, where it has been observed
over a wide range, but most clearly and
frequently in the Baekergunge district,
of which Barisal is the headquarters.
The Barisal guns are heard most frequently
from February to October, not
during fine weather but just before, during,
or immediately after heavy rain.
They always sound in triplets&mdash;that is,
three reports occur, one after another,
at regular intervals&mdash;and though several
guns may be heard, the number is always
three or a multiple of three. Sometimes
only one series of triplets of sounds is
remarked in a day; at other times the
author has counted as many as forty-five
of them, one after another, without
a pause. The report is exactly like the
firing of big guns heard at a distance,
except that it is always double, or has
an echo. A number of conjectural solutions
of the phenomenon have been put
forth, but none of them accounts for it
as a whole in any approaching a satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p><b>Photographing Live Fishes.</b>&mdash;A
number of methods are mentioned by
Dr. R.&nbsp;W. Schufeldt, in a paper on the
subject, by which fishes may be photographed
in their natural element, with
natural surroundings. This can be done,
even under the surface of the water, by
the use of certain subaquatic apparatus.
By the employment of instantaneous
photography some fishes have been
taken in the air, as of salmon in the act
of leaping, or of flying fish in flight.
Such pictures, however, illustrate special
habits rather than the ordinary life
of the subjects. Well-arranged aquariums
afford opportunities for photographing
fishes in almost every condition
and position, and a command of
light and situation can be had in them
which is of great advantage to the operator.
The specimens of fish photographs
published by the author with his paper
are in every way satisfactory. The spots
on the sunfish, for example, are almost
as clear and distinct as if we had the
fish lying before us in the broad light.
The photograph of the pike has afforded
opportunity to correct some inaccuracies
in the drawing of it as given
in previous works of high authority.</p>

<p><b>Marine Life at Cold Spring Harbor,
Long Island.</b>&mdash;Mr. Francis N.
Beach, in presenting to the Boston Society
of Natural History a list of the
Marine Mollusca of Cold Spring Harbor,
Long Island, speaks of the locality as
representing “a fairly distinct facies of
molluscan life&mdash;the fauna of the oyster
beds, broadly speaking. From this
point of view, its homogeneity and the
absence of stragglers lend it value. Probably
almost every species enumerated
lives on the spot where found or in the
immediate vicinity. This characteristic
makes the spot a good sample of actual
conditions of life in that interesting
transitional region where the ‘Virginian’
and ‘Acadian’ (or ‘Boreal’)
faunas overlap. From this point of
view it is, so far from being homogeneous,
strikingly heterogeneous.” Of the
two faunas, the southern one contributes
a quota rather more than twice that
of the more northern one, and the increase
in the preponderance of southern
forms can be detected in a range of
forty miles. The author concludes from
his examination that, notwithstanding
the well-marked character of Cold
Spring Harbor as “muddy,” its molluscan
fauna is determined not at all by
that character, but predominantly by
the depth of water and by the factors
included in the “inclosedness” of the
place&mdash;that is, he supposes, by the temperature,
the specific gravity, the percentage
of organic matter, etc. “It looks
as though the various species would
manage somehow to be represented on
almost any stretch of shore or bottom,
provided only the <i>water conditions</i> be
right.”</p>

<p><b>Farm Homes for Neglected City
Children.</b>&mdash;The system of providing
homes upon farms is represented in the
last annual report of the New York
Juvenile Asylum as being on the wane.
While from 1880 to 1890 twenty-four
per cent of the children committed to
the asylum were placed in Western
homes, the percentage from 1890 to 1897
was only fifteen. Among the reasons
assigned for this diminution are the increase
of undesirable material, chiefly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
races against which prejudice is strong,
and the growing habit of parents expecting
their children to be restored to
them when their services become profitable.
Placing out street waifs and

homes of private families, the report
says, has been sadly abused. The degradation
and moral corruption of the
condition of such children are apt to
make them so refractory and unsusceptible
to the wholesome influences of
family life that an abrupt transfer is
liable to be attended with failure and
disaster. The children should therefore
be previously brought under the restraining
and reformatory influences of
a training school. At the best, a placing-out
work can not be exempt from
serious contingencies. “The second decade,
the adolescent age, under most favorable
conditions, is the period when
the will is apt to be wholly dominated
by the emotions, and unless the environment
is peculiarly favorable, guardianship
becomes a difficult function. With
an indenturing system that prolongs
the term of apprenticeship for boys
throughout their minority, both apprentice
and guardian must possess an extraordinary
measure of amiable qualities
to insure a continuance of their
relation through an extended period.”
When the boy is old enough to earn
wages from strangers the temptation to
leave and go out for hire is very strong,
and must be met by a corresponding
degree of tact and liberality; and even
when interests are happily adjusted “a
placing-out system ought to take account
of the tastes and aptitudes of
young people, and leave the way open
for the deserving at a suitable age to
start upon a new career.”</p>

<p><b>Animals Helping One Another.</b>&mdash;While
the ruminant animals as a rule
do not seem to have made any further
advance toward forming communal
groups than to post sentinels while pasturing
together, a few marked cases are
found in which a division of labor and
some system of assistance seem to have
been given effect. One such instance is
cited in the London Spectator as having
been observed by Lord Lovat in the
Highland deer, where large stags have
smaller stags to attend them and serve
them very much as the English school
bully is attended and served by his fag.
Lord Lovat tells another story of compassion
manifested and help afforded by
a stag to a younger animal. Of three
stags on the move, two jumped the wire
fence, and the third, a two-year-old,
halted and would not venture the leap.
The two waited for some time while the
little fellow ran along the fence, till the
larger of them came back to coax
him, and “actually kissed him several
times.” Finally, the animal gave up and
went on, after which the little stag took
courage and made the jump. The social
organization is very far advanced
with the beavers, and is quite elaborate
with the rabbits, which excavate common
and interlacing burrows, and with
insects like ants and bees.</p>

<p><b>Geological Formations and Forests
in New Jersey.</b>&mdash;From a study of
the relation between forestry and geology
in New Jersey, Arthur Hollick finds
that two distinctly defined forest zones
have long been recognized in the State&mdash;a
deciduous and a coniferous&mdash;the
contrast between the two being so obvious
as to attract the attention even
of superficial observers. While the deciduous
zone is roughly confined to the
northern part of the State and the coniferous
to the southern part, yet when
the line of demarcation is carefully followed
up across the State and beyond
its confines it is found not to coincide
with any parallel of latitude or isothermal
line, and not to be entirely dependent
either on topography or the physiographic
conditions. “If, however, a
geological map of the region be examined,
the line of demarcation between
the two zones will be found to follow
the trend of the geologic formations
whose outcrops extend in a northeast
direction across the State and southward
beyond. A coincidence was suggested,
and it became more apparent, as
the investigations proceeded, that the
two classes of angiosperms and gymnosperms
were severally identified with
certain geological formations, and also
that the distribution of many species
within each of the zones was capable
of being similarly associated, and their
limits of being more or less accurately
defined. The deciduous zone is roughly
located as lying north of a line between
Woodbridge and Trenton, and the coniferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
zone as being south of a line between
Eatontown and Salem. Between
these two lines is an area about sixteen
miles wide where these zones overlap,
which the author calls the “tension
zone,” because a constant state of strain
or tension in the struggle for existence
prevails in it. In the deciduous zone
the geological formations are numerous,
with various soils and every gradation
of topography, and the diversity of trees
is great. Its southern line is coterminous
with the southern edge of the Triassic
formation. The coniferous zone
presents but little diversity in geology
or topography, and little variety of
trees. Its northern border is coterminous
with the northern border of Tertiary
gravels, sands, and sandy clays.
The “tension zone” includes practically
the whole of the Cretaceous plastic
clays, and the clay-marls and marls.</p>

<p>A conference was appointed, to be
held at Wiesbaden, Germany, October
9th and 10th, to promote the formation
of an International Federation of Science&mdash;a
scheme which was referred to
in Sir Michael Foster’s presidential address
before the British Association.
This idea for the establishment of an international
association of great learned
societies appears, the London Athenæum
says, to be the outcome of discussions
carried on at Göttingen in 1898.
For some time past the Academies of
Vienna, Munich, Göttingen, and Leipsic
have been federated into an association
or “Castell,” each meeting in turn at
their respective headquarters to talk
over scientific matters of joint interest.
At two or three recent meetings questions
were brought up, such as antarctic
research and the cataloguing of scientific
literature, which, besides being of sufficient
interacademic value to come before
the “Castell,” were of prime importance
to English men of science. English delegates
were therefore invited to attend,
and did so; and out of this invitation
has grown a desire for a wider international
basis for the association. The
adherence of the principal learned societies
of the world, including our National
Academy, is said to have been secured
to the movement.</p>

<p>The thirteenth season of the Department
of Botany at the Marine Biological
Laboratory, Woods Holl, Mass.,
will open July 5th and continue till
August 16th. Three laboratory courses
are provided, accompanied by lectures,
including the subjects of cryptogamic
botany, plant physiology, and plant
cytology and micro-technique. The
principal instructors are Dr. Bradley
R. Davis, Mr. George T. Moore, and Dr.
Rodney H. True. The department extends
a special welcome to investigators,
and desires their co-operation in the development
of the laboratory. Woods
Holl offers great attractions in variety
of material and facilities for biological
research, and is proposed as an excellent
center of resort where the botanists
of the country may meet for a few
weeks. A six weeks’ course in Nature
study, including both animals and
plants, and consisting largely of field
work, is a new feature offered this year
for the first time.</p>

<p>On Friday, March 9th, occurred the
death of two of the six surviving
founders of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science&mdash;Dr.
Charles E. West, of Brooklyn, and
Professor Oliver Payson Hubbard, of
Manhattan. Both were distinguished
teachers. Dr. West was born in Washington,
Mass., in 1809, and after being
graduated from Union College, began
his career as a teacher in the Albany
Female Academy. He was afterward
principal of the Rutgers Female Institute,
the Buffalo Female Seminary, and
the Brooklyn Heights Seminary, where
he remained twenty-nine years. He
also assisted in preparing the original
courses of instruction of Vassar Female
College. He was one of the founders of
the Long Island Historical Society; was
a fellow of the Royal Antiquarian Society
of Denmark; and was a member of
the American Ethnological, the American
Philosophical, and the New York
and the Long Island Historical Societies.
Professor Hubbard was born at Pomfret,
Conn., in 1809, was graduated from
Yale College in 1828, and was appointed
Professor of Chemistry, Pharmacy, and
Mineralogy at Dartmouth College in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
1836. He remained there, with an interval,
from 1866 till 1871, in which he
devoted himself to lecturing, till 1883,
when he became professor emeritus.
He was made in 1871 overseer of the
Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth,
and he was a member of the
New Hampshire Legislature in 1863 and
1864. Only four of the founders of the
American Association are now living&mdash;namely,
Dr. Martin H. Boye, of Cooperstown,
Pa.; Prof. Walcott Gibbs, of
Harvard; Dr. Samuel L. Abbot; and
Epes Dixwell.</p>

<p>The firm of Burroughs, Wellcome &amp;
Co., says the Lancet, are to be congratulated
on the generous care which
they have taken to promote the material
and intellectual welfare of their employees.
Their principal works are at
Dartford, where they employ more than
eight hundred persons of both sexes,
including some two hundred scientific
workers. For the purpose of establishing
a sort of club for these employees,
Mr. Wellcome succeeded in purchasing
the Manor House known as Acacia Hall,
and the extensive and beautiful grounds
in which it is situated. The Manor
House he has fitted up as a club for the
members of his staff. An old mill which
stands close by has been converted into
what is called the library building. The
upper floor is fitted out as a lecture-room,
and there is a library which already
contains some thousands of volumes.
A third building, called the
Tower House, contains club accommodations
for men. Then there are elaborate
bathrooms, and finally a large gymnasium.
The grounds are most extensive,
being half a mile in length and very
tastefully laid out. There is a lake, a
river, and many pleasure boats for rowing,
a large field for sports of all sorts,
a grand stand to witness the same, a
rich orchard and a beautiful pleasure
garden, several luxurious lawns, and
many superb trees.</p>

<p>A peculiar kind of glassy bodies,
known as moldavite or bouteillenstein,
is attracting the attention of Austrian
and Bohemian geologists. These glasses
are ovals from an inch to an inch and a
half long, and are characterized by various
markings, some of which suggest
finger impressions, while others form a
network of furrows, which may have in
part a rough radial arrangement. They
have been regarded by some authors as
relics of prehistoric glass manufacture,
but this view does not appear to have
been sustained. Dr. F.&nbsp;E. Suess, the famous
Austrian geologist, finds resemblances
between them and meteorites,
and the most general disposition of students
of the subject is now to consider
them of extra-terrestrial origin. Resemblances
have further been pointed out
between them and some peculiar obsidian
bombs found in Australia. The moldavites
in Bohemia occur in sandy deposits
which are assigned to the late
Tertiary or early Diluvial period.</p>

<p>At the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, besides studies bearing directly
on science and the arts, courses
are given in modern languages, as an
important means of access to foreign
works in the student’s professional department:
English, for the purpose of
training pupils to express themselves
readily, accurately, and adequately, and
of aiding them in the understanding
and appreciation of good literature; history
and political and social science, the
instruction in which is arranged to connect
with that in biology, so that the
two departments shall present “an unbroken
sequence of related studies extending
through three successive years,
and resting upon the fundamental
knowledge of living forms and of prehistoric
man that is presented in general
biology, zoölogy, and anthropology,”
followed by comparative politics
and international law; and economics.</p>

<p>A witness recently admitted to the
British Government’s Committee now
making inquiry into the use of coloring
matters and preservatives in food,
that yellow coloring substances were
largely purchased without any discrimination
for the purpose of giving a rich
appearance to milk and milk products.
As a rule, no question was asked as to
the injurious or non-injurious character
of the dye so used. One of the best
coloring matters was known as Martius’s
yellow, naphthol yellow, naphthalene
yellow, Manchester yellow, saffron
yellow, or golden yellow, and is
chemically the same as the dinitro-alpha-naphthol
prepared from the naphthalene
that crystallizes in gas mains,
which is an important constituent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the making of lyddite. It is slightly explosive
when heated, is injurious when
it comes in contact with an abrasion
of the skin, and has been shown by
physiological experiments to be a highly
improper substance to mix with food.</p>

<p>A goose market is held regularly in
October at Warsaw, Poland, to which
about three million geese are brought,
most of them to be exported to Germany.
Often coming from remote provinces,
many of these geese have to travel
over long distances, upon roads which
would wear out their feet if they were
not “shod.” For this purpose they are
driven first through tar poured upon
the ground, and then through sand.
After the operation has been repeated
several times the feet of the geese become
covered with a hard crust that
effectively protects them.</p>

<p>A curious fall of “black snow,”

glaciers.</p>

<p>How to write 1900 in Roman numerals
is a question of the day that will
have to be settled. Three ways are suggested
by Mr. J. Fletcher Little in the
London Times, either of which is correct
according to the Roman system.
They are MDCCCC, MDCD, and MCM.
But when we reach the year 1988, if we
use the first of these methods we shall
have to write the formidable-looking
formula MDCCCCLXXXVIII, whereas
if we use the third and shortest method,
it will only be MCMLXXXVIII&mdash;and
that is long enough. The third method,
therefore, which may be interpreted as
meaning one thousand plus another
thousand lacking a hundred, seems to
be the simplest.</p>

<p>Dr. St. George Mivart, Professor
of Biology in University College, Kensington,
died suddenly in London, April
1st, aged seventy-two years. He was
author of numerous scientific works, of
treatises critical of Darwinism and the
theory of evolution, and of demonstrations
of the harmony of Roman Catholic
dogma with proved scientific facts.
His name has been made prominent of
late by his recantation of his previously
expressed views of the consistency of
dogma with science, and the correspondence
with Cardinal Vaughan
which grew out of it.</p>

<p>In a method of sterilization of water
by means of ozone, described by Dr.
Weyl, of Berlin, at the German Scientific
Conference, 1899, water is pumped
to the top of a tower and allowed to
flow freely over stones, meeting as it
falls a current of air charged with
ozone. The process appears to be likewise
effectual in purifying peat and bog
water, the solution of the iron salts of
humic acid being decomposed and oxidized,
and the brown color disappearing
in consequence. The method, it is said,
can be advantageously used in connection
with filter beds.</p>
